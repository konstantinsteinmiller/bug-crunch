/**
 * ─── The career simulator ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A stage is not the unit of balance. A *career* is.
 *
 * Everything the stage-by-stage study measures is conditional on a save file it
 * invents: it wipes `tower_state`, plays stage 12 with a level-0 shop and no
 * challenge streak, and reports a clear rate for a situation that cannot occur.
 * Nobody arrives at stage 12 with nothing bought and nothing cleared. The three
 * systems that decide whether stage 12 is hard — the upgrades the player owns,
 * the challenge streak they built getting there, and the relief they earned by
 * failing — are all functions of the twenty runs BEFORE it, and a harness that
 * resets between samples measures a game nobody plays.
 *
 * So: a career starts at stage 1 with an empty wallet and an empty shop, plays
 * each stage with a policy, banks what it earns, SPENDS it through a purchasing
 * strategy, and carries the whole save forward — coins, upgrade levels,
 * `ts_challenge`, `ts_failed_stages` — until it clears the last stage or gets
 * stuck. The autobalancer engages because the save it reads is real, which is
 * half of what there is to measure here.
 *
 * ─── What "stuck" means ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `STUCK_AFTER` consecutive losses on the same stage. Five, because the
 * escalating relief tops out at four failures (0.80 → 0.72 → 0.66 → 0.62 and
 * then holds): a player who has lost five times has been given everything the
 * game has to give and is still losing, and no sixth attempt is going to be
 * different. It is also, roughly, where real players stop.
 *
 * ─── The two things that make the numbers trustworthy ───────────────────────
 *
 *   1. ONE GRAPH PER CAREER. The module graph is re-evaluated at the start of
 *      each career and never during it, so `levels`, `challenge` and the
 *      failure record all persist exactly the way they do for a player, and no
 *      career can inherit the previous one's shop.
 *   2. NO MICROTASKS MID-RUN. `playOne` is synchronous. `useUpgrades` refreshes
 *      itself from a Vue `watch`, which flushes on the microtask queue, so an
 *      `await` inside a run would let the shop move under a stage already in
 *      flight. Purchases happen between attempts and only between attempts.

 * the boss's melt floor is priced off the crowd's real firepower, weapon
