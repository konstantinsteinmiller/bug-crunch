/**
 * ─── The difficulty curve, locked in ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The long study in `study.test.ts` produces the tables; THIS file is the part
 * that has to keep passing. It is deliberately tiny — a handful of seeds, a few
 * seconds — because a regression test that takes four minutes is a regression
 * test somebody eventually deletes.
 *
 * It guards the two ends of the curve, which are the two things a tuning pass
 * is most likely to break in opposite directions:
 *
 *   THE FLOOR   — stage 1 must not punish a player who has not yet worked out
 *                 that the screen does anything. A first session that ends
 *                 eleven seconds in ends the install.
 *   THE CEILING — `optimal` must clear stages 1–5. If the benchmark player
 *                 cannot finish the hand-authored stages, no tuning of the
 *                 procedural ones downstream means anything.
 *
 * And one thing in between: playing well has to beat playing badly, on every
 * stage. That is the whole brief ("punish players for not playing the optimal
 * path") reduced to something a test can check. It is asserted on DPS AT THE
 * BOSS rather than on peak squad, because peak squad turns out to be nearly
 * flat across policies on stages 1–4 (see the report) — the spread lives
 * entirely in damage and fire rate, which is to say in the crates.
 *
 * Run it: `npx vitest run tests/sim/balance.test.ts`

 * The tables live in `tests/sim/scratch.adaptive.test.ts` and the pure-function
 * contracts in `tests/game/adaptiveBoss.test.ts`. These three are the ones that
 * have to keep passing, and each guards one end of the brief the system was
 * built to satisfy:
 *
 *   playing well has to BUY something, and under an adaptive bar what it buys
 *   is a shorter climax rather than an easier one;
 *   nobody may delete the boss, however overwhelming they arrive;
 *   nobody may be handed a bar that outlives the ten-second ceiling.
 *
 * All three are measured through the shipping simulation, because the failure
 * mode being guarded against is precisely a pure function that is correct in
 * isolation and wired up wrong.
