/**
 * A scratch probe, not a regression: it asserts nothing and only reports.
 *
 *   SIM_RAMP=1 npx vitest run tests/sim/scratch.ramp.test.ts --reporter=verbose
 *
 * `--reporter=verbose` is load-bearing — Vitest 4's default reporter swallows
 * `console.log` from a passing test.
 *
 * ── What it measures, and why not the full-run study ──
 *
 * "Stage N is a difficulty spike" is a claim about the road, and the full-run
 * tables cannot answer it: they measure whether a scripted policy CLEARS a
 * stage, which conflates the road with the crowd the player brought to it. This
 * builds each track and adds up what is standing on it — total foe health,
 * elite health, boss health, the scenery that has to be steered around, crate
 * health — and then prints each stage AGAINST THE ONE BEFORE IT.
 *
 * The ratios are the point. A campaign that ramps has neighbours in the same
 * band; a cliff is a single ratio two or three times its neighbours', and that
 * is what a player reports as "stage N got hard suddenly".
 *
 * Read with `earlyFoeHpMul` and the rest of the onboarding curves in
 * `survival.ts` — they are the dials this table responds to, and the block
 * comment there records what it said before and after the last pass.
 *
 * The `boss` column reads 0 for stages 1-5 and that is not a bug: their boss is
 * no longer a property of the road at all. It is priced at the arena door
 * against the firepower that walked in (`game/adaptive.ts`), and
 * `tests/sim/scratch.adaptive.test.ts` is the probe that measures it.
