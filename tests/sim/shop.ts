/**
 * ─── Scripted shoppers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A *strategy* is a player standing in front of the upgrade screen, expressed
 * as a pure function of the wallet:
 *
 *     next(view) → the track to buy, or null to bank the coins
 *
 * The career simulator calls it in a loop after every attempt — win or lose,
 * exactly when the real shop is reachable — and stops when it returns `null` or
 * the wallet cannot cover the price. A strategy may read the view and nothing
 * else: it never touches the simulation, never sees a future stage, and cannot
 * spend coins it does not have.
 *
 * ─── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "The player uses upgrades smartly" is a CLAIM, and a shop with four tracks
 * either has one right answer or it has a choice. Those two cases look
 * identical from inside the game and completely different in a table: if one
 * strategy dominates, the shop is a single-track ladder wearing four coats, and
 * whichever track it always picks is under-priced. So the strategies below are
 * chosen to bracket the space rather than to be good:
 *
 *   none         — the control. Every number the shop is worth is measured
 *                  against this line.
 *   cheapest     — buys whatever is cheapest that touches DPS. The player who
 *                  clicks the affordable button. Never saves, never plans.
 *   balanced     — round-robins all four tracks. The "spread it evenly" player,
 *                  and the one that catches a track being strictly ignorable.
 *   value        — marginal DPS per coin, with scavenge priced through its own
 *                  payback. The approximation of "optimal", and the yardstick
 *                  the other two are graded against.
 *   scavengeFirst— four levels of economy, then DPS. The idle-game reflex.
 *   rateFirst    — fire rate to the cap first. Tests the one stat the DESIGN
 *                  says a run cannot start high.
 *
 * If `value` beats the rest by a wide margin the shop is a puzzle; if
 * `cheapest` matches it, the shop is a ladder and the prices are wrong.
