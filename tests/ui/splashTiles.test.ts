/**
 * The two splashes are one picture.
 *
 * `index.html` paints the backdrop before any script runs and
 * `FLogoProgress.vue` takes over when Vue mounts. The tile layer is the part
 * of that handover with a clock in it: both sides pan the same image by the
 * same distance over the same duration, and `adoptAnimationClock` copies where
 * the first one had got to onto the second. Let any of those three numbers
 * drift apart and the crossfade shows the pattern doubled, sliding against
 * itself — which is exactly the artefact nobody looks for, because it only
 * exists for the 400 ms the two layers overlap.
 *
 * jsdom renders neither layer, so these are SOURCE checks, plus a look at the
 * tile file itself for the properties the CSS assumes about it.
