// ─── TNT barrels ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The boss arena's damage lever, and the answer to the one stretch of the
// climax where the player had no offence at all.
//
// A boss plants and raises a shield at fixed health gates; during that phase
// gunfire is designed to do nothing and the correct play is to MOVE. Honest, but
// it left the player holding a thumb against an invulnerable target. Barrels
// give them something to shoot that still counts — and something to reach for
// when a boss simply out-scales their crowd.
//
// The two properties that make it a lever rather than a solution:
//   • the blast lands THROUGH the shield, and
//   • it still cannot skip a guard gate, so the boss owes the player every
//     phase it always did.
