/**
 * ─── The offline ladder ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE BOARD MUST NEVER LOOK BROKEN. A leaderboard that says "Couldn't reach the
 * leaderboard" has failed twice — at the request, and at the player, who reads
 * it as a bug in the game.
 *
 * It is not a hypothetical failure. The Worker's D1 row-read allowance ran out
 * mid-afternoon and `/top` threw for every live build at once, with real
 * players on it. So the game shows the best board it has, and never says which:
 *
 *   1. this session's live fetch
 *   2. the cache written by a previous session
 *   3. the snapshot baked at build time
 *
 * These cases pin the ladder, the silence, and the one rule that keeps it from
 * becoming its own bug: a cached board must never stop the refresh.
