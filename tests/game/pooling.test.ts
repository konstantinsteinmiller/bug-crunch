// ─── Object pools: monsters and rounds ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A late stage fields packs of dozens at a time, the summoner adds waves on top,
// and a gatling emits on the order of two hundred rounds a second. All of them
// are born, live under a second and die — the exact shape that fills a nursery
// and buys a GC pause in the middle of a fight. So both are recycled.
//
// Pooling is the optimisation with the nastiest failure mode in the catalogue,
// because when it breaks it does not crash: a recycled body arrives carrying a
// field from its previous life, and the symptom is a creep that rolls down one
// lane like a boss's ball, or an ordinary monster that the HUD announces as a
// miniboss. It is a bug that looks like a balance problem, months later.
//
// So this file pins the two things that make it safe:
//
//   1. bodies really ARE reused — otherwise the whole change is dead code that
//      only added a branch;
//   2. a reused body remembers NOTHING. Every field of a recycled monster is
//      the blank's, not its predecessor's.
//
// …and the third thing, which is about the removal rather than the allocation:
// swap-and-pop must never drop a live entity on the floor.
