/**
 * ─── The two elites the late tier adds ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four elites is enough variety to stop a stage being one fight and not enough
 * to stop a CAREER being four. `MINIBOSS_TIER2_FROM_STAGE` is where the pool
 * grows by two, and the two are chosen for the questions the first four never
 * ask:
 *
 *   WARDEN    where is the GAP. The whole road is lethal except one slot, so the
 *             input is aiming FOR a mark rather than flinching away from one —
 *             the only hazard in the game that inverts the verb.
 *   BURROWER  which WAY are you going. It arrives where the crowd was half a
 *             second ago, so sustained movement is a clean escape, stopping is
 *             caught, and reversing runs back down your own trail into it.
 *
 * Both are measured the way the first four were: as OUTCOMES over the real
 * `step()` loop, comparing a policy that answers the question against one that
 * does not. The failure this catches is the one the claw's history records and
 * the bomber's arithmetic nearly repeated — geometry that reads as an attack and
 * cannot actually be answered, or can be answered by standing still.
