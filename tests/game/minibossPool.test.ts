// ─── The three fights that are not the scythe ───────────────────────────────
//
// A miniboss used to be one thing: plant, wind up, sweep the road. It is four
// things now (`MinibossKind`), and the three new ones exist because the old one
// asks exactly one question — "how hard do you hit" — and a road that asks it
// six stages running is a road people stop walking down.
//
// Each test below is about a CLAIM the design makes out loud, measured through
// the real `step()` loop:
//
//   roller  owns half the road, never tracks, never walls the run. A crowd in
//           the free half pays nothing; one in its lane pays a bounded share,
//           once.
//   bomber  stands still while the fuse burns, and the LURE is the dodge.
//           Waiting on the centre line and running late is a PARTIAL escape by
//           construction — that is the whole reason to lead it somewhere first.
//   gunner  the line it showed you is the line the round takes, it kills only
//           what it passes through, and the toll is the same at 30 fps as at 60.
//
// Every stage here is chosen for the kind it fields and every one of them
// ASSERTS that kind. Two tests in `roadEconomy.test.ts` were left sitting on
// stage 4 when the pool opened and went quiet rather than red — passing while
// measuring a fight that was no longer there. That is the failure these
// assertions exist to prevent.

 *   • the elite under test is immortal. A hundred survivors with the stage's own
 *     damage kill a stage-4 miniboss on the approach (the benchmark player's
 *     fight there is measured at 0.2 s), so without this most of these tests
 *     would be asking their question of a corpse.
 *   • every OTHER elite is parked far up the road. All minibosses bill their
 *     kills under the same `elite` cause, so a second landmark's bites would be
 *     booked against the first one's attack.

 * prove a ball does not home, which is a line no player runs and one that walks
 * the crowd through every solid on the road — so whether it reaches the elite at
 * all comes down to how wide the crowd happens to be when it clips a barricade
 * eighty units earlier. Measured, that flipped on stage-4 layout changes that
 * have nothing to do with rollers, and the test then failed with "no roller ever
 * streamed in": a precondition dressed as a result.
