/**
 * ─── What the onboarding hold hands the player, measured ────────────────────
 *
 * `GameScene` sets `steerOnly` for the movement tutorial and `step()` returns
 * early on it, so the ROAD is frozen while the crowd still shoots. Stage 1's
 * opening doorway stands inside the first screen (`OPENING_GATE_Y`) and is
 * therefore pumped for the WHOLE hold — the player leaves the lightbox holding
 * a door that a run without the hold would never have finished pumping.
 *
 * That is a deliberate piece of showmanship (see `stageOne`) and it is not
 * being taken away. What it needs is a road priced for it, and this file is the
 * instrument that says by how much: it drives the real simulation through
 * stage 1 twice — once the way a first run actually goes, once with the road
 * running from frame one — and reports the delta at each of the three places
 * stage 1 is supposed to ask a question.
 *
 * ─── What it found, and the part that was NOT the hold ──────────────────────
 *
 * The reported symptom was "+10 from the first gate alone, before the pickup
 * wall … the mini-boss dies in 0.25 seconds". Both halves are real and the
 * simulation reproduces them exactly. The CAUSE is only half the story:
 *
 *   the hold is worth ONE survivor. The opening door is inside the first screen
 *   and in range from frame one, so a run that never sees the lightbox arrives
 *   at the teaching wall with 12 against the held run's 13 — the door pumps to
 *   9 on its own and the hold buys the last point of `OPENING_PUMP_CAP`.
 *
 *   the `+10` itself is worth SEVEN. The opener is a `+3` that pumps to 10, and
 *   the beats behind it were priced for the squad of ~6 a `+3` used to produce.
 *   What actually walks the road is 13 at the wall and 24-47 at the elite.
 *
 * So the correction is a road priced for a capped door rather than anything to
 * do with `steerOnly`, and the elite is where it landed — 26 hp against 104-430
 * dps, dying in 0.18-0.55 s. See `MINIBOSS_TUTORIAL` for the arithmetic and the
 * before/after table.
 *
 * One trap for whoever reads the printed table next: `optimal` shows 47
 * survivors at the elite against everyone else's 24-26, and that is NOT the
 * pump compounding. Stage 1's last bank sits at y = 89 and the elite at
 * y = 90.9, so whether the crowd has banked that door when the first round
 * lands is decided by a metre and a half of road.
 *
 * It is a measurement harness first and a regression test second, which is why
 * the assertions are bands rather than snapshots: the numbers above move
 * whenever the stage-1 road is re-authored, and a test that pins them to two
 * decimals is a test that gets deleted the first time somebody moves a crate.
 */

/**
 * How long a stranger looks at the lightbox before their first input.
 *
 * The tutorial clock accrues NOTHING until the player has touched the game
 * (`tickTutorial`'s `sawInput`), so this is dead time in which the road is
 * frozen and the opening door is being shot — which is exactly the window the
 * pump lives in. Two seconds is deliberately conservative: the same measurement
 * at four seconds moves nothing, because the door caps at `OPENING_PUMP_CAP`
 * well inside the first second and a half (see `gatePump.test.ts`).
