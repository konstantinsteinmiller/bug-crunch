/**
 * The summoner wears the body it raises.
 *
 * The boss body used to be picked purely by stage, cycling five designs so a
 * returning player recognises the silhouette. The summoner broke that: it
 * raises marrow knights out of the road, and on its first stage the cycle
 * handed it a boar — a boar conjuring skeleton knights reads as a bug, not as
 * a boss. So the summoner is always the Marrow Knight, at boss size, and the
 * other kinds keep their place in the cycle.
