// The melt floor — the boss-HP guarantee for stages 6+.
//
// Reported from stage 45+: a run that read the road arrives with ~1500-4000
// survivors and the authored curve is gone before the boss finishes walking in.
// Measured over an `optimal` career (seed 4242, shop on `value()`), stages 45-50
// were being killed in 0.39-0.86 s of fire. The floor prices the bar at
// `BOSS_MIN_FIRE_SECONDS` of the run's OWN firepower whenever that is more than
// the curve asks for, and leaves the curve alone otherwise.
//
// Two promises, and this file exists because each can break without the other
// showing any symptom:
//
//   1. it RAISES and never lowers — mid and low runs must be untouched, because
//      the whole reason adaptive pricing stops at stage 5 is that a bar always
//      exactly as big as you are is a bar your upgrades can never beat;
//   2. a bomb cannot delete the guarantee. A grenade deals `squadDps × mult` in
//      one hit and the floor is worth `BOSS_MIN_FIRE_SECONDS × squadDps`, so at
//      the base multiplier of 3 those are the same number — the floor would buy
//      three seconds and the bomb would spend all of them.
