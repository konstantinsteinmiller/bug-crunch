/**
 * ─── The lean ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `×3` at the end of a stage is the game's primary income, so declining it
 * has to cost something the player can feel during the NEXT run rather than
 * only six stages later when the shop is empty.
 *
 * Three properties make that a nudge instead of a punishment, and all three are
 * invisible in a screenshot:
 *
 *   1. one claim buys back the whole curve (it resets, it is not a debt);
 *   2. it is capped, so a player who never watches an ad still has a finite,
 *      beatable game;
 *   3. it never fires for an offer that was not actually there.
 *
 * (3) lives in the scene — a decline is only recorded when `canOfferReward` was
 * true while the result screen was up — so what is asserted here is the curve
 * itself and the bounds the scene relies on.
