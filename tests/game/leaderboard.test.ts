/**
 * ─── The board's quota contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The leaderboard runs on a free-tier Cloudflare Worker over D1, and the client
 * is the only thing standing between that and a bill. Two rules carry the whole
 * design, and neither is visible in a screenshot:
 *
 *   READ ONCE PER PAGE LOAD.   WRITE ONLY ON A PERSONAL RECORD.
 *
 * A player grinding stage 30 for an hour must cost exactly one edge-cached GET.
 * Everything here exists to pin that down, plus the other half of the contract:
 * the board is a decoration, so a dead endpoint has to end in "no rank shown"
 * and never in a rejected promise on the path that ends a run.
 *
 * Every case re-imports the module under `vi.resetModules()` because the
 * endpoint is read from `import.meta.env` ONCE, at module scope — which is
 * exactly how a build with no endpoint ships with no leaderboard at all.
