/**
 * ─── One chip, and it says which way the crowd is going ─────────────────────
 *
 * A five-tester first-contact playtest sat people in front of a four-chip stats
 * row and asked them what the chips were. Four of the five could not name one:
 * the orange streak flame was read as a DROPLET by all four, and the bolt and
 * the clock were matched to damage and fire rate only after the player had
 * opened the shop and seen the same glyphs beside their prices. The owner's call
 * was deletion rather than teaching — so three chips are gone, and the one that
 * is left had to start saying what it counts.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the part that is easy to ship broken. The tint is
 * driven by a prop that moves several times a second during a gate payout, so
 * the naive watcher — tint on every change — strobes, and the naive fix — queue
 * the tints — is still playing the payout back after it has ended. The rule is
 * a LATCH:
 *
 *   HELD            one tint, held for a fixed window
 *   EXTENDED        another change the same way pushes the window out; forty
 *                   frames of payout is one continuous green
 *   DROPPED         a change the other way is dropped, not queued
 *   …EXCEPT RED     a loss always interrupts a gain, because the two mistakes
 *                   do not cost the same
 *
 * The milestone punch on the same chip is proved in `tests/ui/runHudMilestone.
 * test.ts`; the two must not touch each other, and the last block here says so.
