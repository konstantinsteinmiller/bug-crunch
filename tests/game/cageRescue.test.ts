/**
 * ─── Rescue cages, from stage 2 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four claims, each one a line of the request:
 *
 *   FROM STAGE 2        the first stage past the thirty-second teach carries one.
 *   THREE TO FIVE EARLY a small squad's worth of people, growing with the stage
 *                       exactly as the doors it competes with do.
 *   70 % OF A WALL      opening it takes real, committed fire — seven tenths of
 *                       one barricade block on the same stage.
 *   THEY WALK OVER      the freed survivors jog to the squad instead of being
 *                       sprung into formation, and they are part of it — counted
 *                       and shooting — from the moment the bars come off.
 *
 * …and the fifth, which is what keeps the first four from being free power: a
 * cage takes the place of one supply crate (`CAGE_TAKES`). That one is pinned in
 * `trackShape.test.ts`, beside the supply floor it deliberately breaks by one.
