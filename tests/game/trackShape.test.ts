// ─── The shape of a stage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The track generator makes promises that are invisible in a screenshot and
// expensive to discover in a playtest:
//
//   1. a stage is a pure function of its number, so a player LEARNS stage 6
//      instead of re-rolling it;
//   2. every gate bank is a real decision — two or three leaves that are never
//      worth the same thing, with a lethal pillar between each pair;
//   3. traps arrive on schedule (`÷` from stage 2, `÷5` from stage 6, never
//      twice in a row, never in the first tenth of a road) instead of whenever
//      the PRNG feels like it;
//   4. every barricade row can be run through by a crowd at full size;
//   5. every stage offers the supplies the run needs — fire rate starts at 1.9
//      shots/s and rate crates are the only way it climbs;
//   6. the difficulty knobs actually RAMP across all thirty stages rather than
//      flattening out somewhere in the middle.
//
// Each one is a one-character change away from silently becoming something
// else, so they are asserted across the whole thirty-stage campaign.

/**
 * The campaign is ENDLESS, so "the whole campaign" is not a list any more.

 * spread of the endless road — including stages past every place the generator
 * used to quietly stop scaling (the beat-gap floor at 32, the trap-odds cap at
 * 30, the multiplier freeze at 6) and past the two measured hard breaks: the
 * `MAX_SQUAD` overrun around stage 86 and the identical-doors break at 161.
 *
 * 300 is the far end because that is roughly a day of unbroken play; if the
