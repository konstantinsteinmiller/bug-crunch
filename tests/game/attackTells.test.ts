// Reported from testing: players do not see the mini-boss's or the boss's attack
// indicator. The reason is where their eyes are — on the boss, or on their own
// thumb — and the one place the game was painting the answer was the patch of
// road they were about to be standing on.
//
// Two things answer it, and they answer different halves. The CASTS say where
// the damage is coming from: a rock falls out of the sky onto the boss's mark, a
// blade winds up across the ground the elite is about to cut. The corner
// WARNING says whether anything is coming at all, from a fixed place that can be
// checked with peripheral vision — which is all a player steering with a thumb
// has spare.
//
// Both depend on timing: a tell that fires with the damage is not a tell, it is
// an explanation afterwards.

/**
 * Every wind-up, and every thing a wind-up turns into.
 *
 * Held as sets rather than as an `||` chain because the vocabulary GREW: the
 * boss is a pool now (`BOSS_POOL`), and a claw announces itself with `rakeCast`
 * and lands as `bossRake` where a meteor uses `meteorCast` / `bossSlam`. The
 * rule under test — nothing lands that was not announced — is the same rule for
 * all of them, and it is the only rule in the game that a NEW attack can break
 * simply by being new. Any kind added to `BOSS_POOL` belongs in both sets.
 *
 * The healer's `bossBoltCast` / `bossBoltHit` are deliberately NOT here: a bolt's damage
 * lands when the projectile arrives, seconds after the cast and at a place the
 * projectile itself is pointing at, so "was there a cast before the hit" is not
 * the question that measures it. `bossKinds.test.ts` measures the bolt on its
 * own terms — that it exists in the world, visibly, before it hurts anybody.
