// ─── The simulation's load-bearing rules ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything asserted in this file is a promise to the player, and every one of
// them is invisible in a screenshot:
//
//   1. SOLID THINGS KILL. Crates, barricades and gate dividers are lethal until
//      they are destroyed — gates alone are doorways rather than walls. Without
//      that, half the level generator's vocabulary is scenery.
//   2. A GATE BANK IS A COMMITMENT. Two leaves, one lethal pillar between them.
//      Straddling the middle has to cost survivors, or the "choose a side"
//      decision the whole track is built around stops being a decision.
//   3. A `+N` GATE IS A DECISION ABOUT TIME. One tick per HALF SECOND of
//      sustained fire — never per bullet — so a squad of five and a squad of
//      fifty pump it at exactly the same rate.
//   4. FIRE RATE IS EARNED IN THE RUN. It starts crawling, never moves on its
//      own, and only rate crates raise it. It is the stat that makes everything
//      else feel good, so it must never be free.
//   5. MINIBOSSES ARE THE MIDPOINT WIN. Every stage past the first has one, it
//      is announced, it pays real coins — and it is emphatically not the end
//      boss, so beating it must not end the stage.
//   6. THE BOSS CAN ACTUALLY HIT YOU. It slams where the CROWD is. A boss whose
//      attack cannot reach is a damage race with no failure state.
//   7. LOSING TEACHES. Die on a stage and every enemy on it loses 20 % health —
//      once, never twice, a floor under frustration rather than a slide.
//
// They are asserted against the real simulation (no canvas, no Vue component)
// because every one of them is a one-character change away from silently
// becoming something else.
