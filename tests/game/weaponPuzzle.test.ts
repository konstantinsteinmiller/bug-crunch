// ─── The weapon puzzle ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One optional beat every OTHER stage that pays out a WEAPON for the rest of
// it: two levers at the road's shoulders, each behind a destructible stone,
// and — twelve units on — an armoured box that only opens if both went over.
//
// It is the only thing in the game that is purely a bonus, which is exactly why
// it needs a test file of its own. Nothing about it fails loudly. A puzzle that
// stops being placed, a box that stays shut after the levers are down, an
// armour plate parked where the crowd cannot get past it, a weapon that leaks
// into the next stage — none of those produce an error, a crash, or anything a
// playtester would report as a bug. They produce a beat that quietly stopped
// paying, and a mechanic nobody mentions again.
//
// So the five promises are pinned here:
//
//   1. every stage `stageHasWeapon` claims carries exactly one, in the middle
//      of the road, and no other stage carries any;
//   2. it is ignorable — the road left beside the armour fits a crowd at full
//      size, so a player who never solves one pays nothing;
//   3. ONE lever is not enough, a lever the crowd ran past cannot be collected
//      later by the cleanup, and every lever is covered by a stone that has to
//      be paid for first;
//   4. the box refuses damage while it is armoured, and pays out when broken;
//   5. the weapon dies with the stage that gave it.

     * failure of a simpler version:
     *
     *   • the pair is re-planted six units ahead EVERY frame. Left where they
     *     were first put, the crowd simply runs past them and the whole sample
     *     comes back empty;
     *   • the crates, walls and boulders of the real stage are cleared every
     *     frame too. A rocket that goes off against a crate splashes whatever is
     *     near the crate, and the sample then measures that instead;
     *   • the near body is OVERSIZED, so its hitbox is wider than the crowd's own
     *     spread and no round can scatter past it. Putting the second body off to
     *     the SIDE instead does not work — rounds are fired from survivors spread
     *     across the crowd's full width, so "beside the line of fire" is still on
     *     somebody's line of fire, and an ordinary round reached it;
     *   • and it runs a FIXED number of frames rather than stopping at the first
     *     hit, because "the first hit" is itself a splash on a busy road.
     *
     * Scale 3 and a half-unit gap are not arbitrary: a round resolves anywhere
     * inside its target's hitbox, so against a wider body a hit could detonate
     * far enough off the centre line to fall outside its own blast. These put the
     * worst-case impact point at 2.2 units from the bystander against a 2.3
     * radius — a guarantee rather than a probability.
