/**
 * ─── The boss has a second half now ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fight had one idea and spent it in the first four seconds: a wind-up, a
 * swing, and then the same swing until somebody fell over. Phase two is the
 * answer — at the guard gate at or below half health the boss turns over, the
 * cadence tightens, the body lights up, and the two kinds whose whole fight was
 * one swing gain a lane charge.
 *
 * Four things can go wrong here and three of them are invisible in a screenshot,
 * so all four are measured against the real `step()` loop:
 *
 *   • the TURN firing twice, or never, or moving — it is a latch on a guard
 *     gate precisely because a health threshold un-crosses, and there is a
 *     healing archetype in the pool whose entire job is to un-cross it;
 *   • the CHARGE landing off the beat its telegraph promised. That is the one
 *     failure this game treats as unforgivable (`useVfx`'s note on the casts),
 *     and the charge is the attack most able to commit it: half of its wind-up
 *     is a body travelling, so the animation and the damage are two clocks that
 *     have to be one;
 *   • the charge being UNDODGEABLE. A lane attack a crowd cannot stand beside is
 *     the claw's original bug (37 % against 38 %) with a different shape;
 *   • the tempo going off the end of the envelope the cadence was tuned inside,
 *     or scaling into a wall at depth. Both are arithmetic, and both are checked
 *     as arithmetic rather than hoped for.
