/**
 * ─── The boss is a pool now, and each kind has to actually be its kind ───────
 *
 * Everything here runs the REAL `step()` loop. That matters more than usual for
 * these three, because all three failed in a previous attempt in ways that a
 * unit test of the geometry would have passed with full marks:
 *
 *   • the CLAW's pockets were spaced at what a claw looks like, and caught 37 %
 *     of a perfectly-dodging crowd against 38 % of a stationary one — a dodge
 *     worth one percentage point;
 *   • the HEALER's every-third heal ran on the shared slam clock, on which a
 *     boss fight is two attacks long, so it never fired once;
 *   • the SUMMONER's spawn pressure was a rate with no total, and above a
 *     threshold the boss simply never took net damage.
 *
 * So the assertions below are all about what the fight COSTS and DOES over a
 * real fight, not about what the numbers say. Where a constant is read, it is
 * read to state a PREMISE ("the crowd really is wider than the furrow") rather
 * than as the expected value of the thing being measured — an assertion that
 * reads the same constant the code does passes for any value and proves nothing.
