// ─── Nothing is drawn standing inside anything else ─────────────────────────
//
// Every other layout rule in `trackShape.test.ts` is about what a beat MEANS —
// a bank is a real choice, a wall has a way through, a trap arrives on
// schedule. This file asserts the one thing a player checks by looking rather
// than by playing: no two props on the road occupy the same piece of ground.
//
// It is asserted here rather than folded into the shape suite because it is a
// different KIND of statement. The shape rules are about the design of a stage;
// this is about whether the stage can be drawn. A crate inside a boulder is not
// a harder stage — it is a box with a rock growing out of it, and a box the
// player cannot shoot, because the round stops on the rock in front of it.
//
// The bodies below are the SIM's, not the renderer's: `CRATE_R`, `CAGE_R`,
// `BULWARK_R` and the rest are what `useSurvivalGame` pushes into its solid
// list and what its bullets are tested against, so a pair that clears here is a
// pair that clears in the fight as well as on screen.
