/**
 * ─── The two roadside prizes ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A rescue cage pays PEOPLE and an auto-shield box pays ONE ABSORB, and between
 * them they are the second and third reasons the road gives a player to leave
 * the racing line. Both are new entity types, so most of what could go wrong
 * with them is invisible from inside the game: a prop that quietly lands on the
 * centre line hands out free crowd to a player who never steers, and a
 * threshold that is a percentage with no floor spends a one-shot pickup on a
 * survivor clipping a barricade.
 *
 * Three groups, in the order the player meets them:
 *
 *   THE PAYOUT     what a cage is worth, measured against the door it competes
 *                  with rather than against itself.
 *   THE PLACEMENT  where the generator is allowed to put them — and, the part
 *                  that is load-bearing, where it is not.
 *   THE ABSORB     what counts as a "big blow", pinned at the boundaries the
 *                  feature was specified with, and then proved end to end
 *                  through the real `step()` loop rather than asserted about
 *                  the arithmetic alone.
