// ─── Every upgrade has to actually arrive ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A player reported that the Squad track "did not have any effect". It was
// true, and it was true of two more tracks beside it.
//
// The shop is reachable from the HUD **during a run**, and three of its seven
// stat tracks were latched at `startStage` and nowhere else: `damage.value`,
// `runFireRate` and the crowd itself are snapshots of `unitDamage`, `fireRate`
// and `startSquad` taken as the stage opened. Buying any of them mid-stage
// spent the coins, raised the level, and changed nothing about the run —
// measured at stage 7 with six levels of each: squad 11 -> 11, damage 1 -> 1,
// rate 1.90 -> 1.90.
//
// Squad is the one that got reported, and that is not luck: the HUD shows the
// live crowd, so it is the only one of the three where the player can WATCH the
// number refuse to move. The other two were equally broken and simply quieter,
// which is the more dangerous condition.
//
// This file is the tripwire. It asks the only question that matters about a
// shop — *did the thing I paid for reach the game?* — of every track, in both
// of the two moments a player can buy: between stages, and mid-run.
