/**
 * ─── The road has no end ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stages 1–5 are hand-authored and 6+ are generated, and there was never a
 * "campaign complete" branch — stage 31 always technically worked. What did NOT
 * work was everything the generator stopped scaling: measured across stages
 * 1–300, fourteen separate knobs hit a hard cap somewhere between stage 17 and
 * stage 34, so a stage-100 road was a stage-34 road with more enemy health.
 *
 * These are the properties that make "endless" mean something. They are
 * asserted deep enough to cover the two breaks that were actually measured:
 * the additive path overrunning `MAX_SQUAD` around stage 86, and gate banks
 * printing identical doors from stage 161.
