// ─── Survivor sprite-strip bake ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Guards the bug that shipped: players on Android Chrome
// ("Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36") ran a whole stage
// with the crowd drawn as plain coloured capsules — `drawUnits`' fallback for a
// unit whose strip has not baked yet.
//
// Nothing was broken. The bake simply never finished. It was driven by
//
//     do { ...bake one frame... } while ((deadline?.timeRemaining() ?? 0) > 8)
//
// which reads like an idle-time budget and is a trap: when `requestIdleCallback`
// fires because its TIMEOUT expired — which is what happens on a main thread
// with no idle slices, i.e. a mid-range phone running a canvas game — the spec
// says `timeRemaining()` returns ZERO. So the loop baked exactly one frame per
// callback. At 3 outfits x 14 frames and a 1200 ms timeout that is roughly a
// minute of capsules. Desktop Chrome has idle time between frames, finishes in
// one or two callbacks, and shows nothing wrong — which is why it never
// surfaced in testing.
//
// The two properties below are what make that impossible to regress into:
// progress must not depend on the idle deadline being generous, and the loading
// screen must not clear before the strips exist.
