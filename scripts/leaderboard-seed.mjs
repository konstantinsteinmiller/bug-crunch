/**
 * ─── The seeded board, for the portals that can never gain a player ─────────
 *
 * Poki forbids every external runtime request and Yandex rejects third-party
 * storage URLs, so those builds ship `VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL` empty: they cannot
 * READ the board and, more to the point here, they can never WRITE to it. Their
 * baked copy is not a stale snapshot of a living board — it is the whole board,
 * for the life of the build, and nobody playing it will ever appear on it.
 *
 * Seeding it from the live board does not work either, and the arithmetic is the
 * reason. The live board is 2 422 players of whom 56 % never got past stage 2
 * and 1.5 % passed stage 20, because it is a record of everyone who ever opened
 * the game once. Ranking a Poki player against that says more about the sample
 * than about them.
 *
 * So this generates a board from a stated RETENTION CURVE instead. It is
 * modelled data, and it is written down as modelled data — see `SURVIVAL`.
 *
 * ── Determinism is the point ──
 *
 * Every number below comes out of a seeded PRNG, so re-running this produces a
 * byte-identical file. A board that churned on every run would move every
 * player's rank for no reason, and a rank that moves without the player doing
 * anything is worse than no rank.

 * The retention curve, as `stage → fraction of players whose BEST is ≥ stage`.
 *
 * A survival function rather than a histogram, because that is the shape the
 * design intent is actually stated in — "most quit on 3 and 4", "only ~8 % go
 * past 20" are both statements about how many are still there, and deriving the
 * per-stage counts from them cannot drift out of agreement with them.
 *
 *   1 → 1.000   everyone reaches stage 1
 *   3 → 0.930     7 % gave up on 1-2         "some few on stage 1 and 2"
 *   5 → 0.620    31 % gave up on 3-4         "most players quit on 3 and 4"
 *  11 → 0.250    37 % gave up on 5-10        "most players play till 5-10"
 *  21 → 0.080    17 % gave up on 11-20
 *  44 → 0.00065  the top ~100 of 154 331     "the best players reach 40+"
 *
 * The far tail is anchored on the POPULATION, not chosen for its own sake: the
 * published hundred is the top 0.065 % of 154 331, so wherever the curve crosses
 * that fraction is where the visible board starts. The anchors put it at stage
 * 46, which is what "the best reach 40+" means at this size — at a tenth of the
 * population the same phrasing would want a much shallower tail, so re-check
 * this line before changing `TOTAL`.
 *
 * The anchors between 21 and 30 are close together for one reason: the bands
 * the spec asks for imply a WALL at 20 (17 % of everyone stops in 11-20, and
 * only 8 % are left after it), and a step in the drop-off rate is a step in the
 * histogram. Spread over four anchors the rate steepens gradually instead, and
 * the largest remaining rise between adjacent stages is under 3 % — down from
 * 15 % with a single anchor, where stage 21 visibly held more players than
 * stage 20.
 *
 * Interpolated log-linearly between anchors, which is what makes the middle of
 * a band decay smoothly instead of stepping at the anchors — a histogram with
 * visible steps in it reads as generated the moment anyone plots it.
