/**
 * The first thing a new player ever sees.
 *
 * A crowd runner has exactly one control, and a player who does not find it in
 * the first few seconds bounces. Every other primer in this game is a pill of
 * text that appears while the road is already moving; this one holds the road
 * still and asks for the gesture, because "move" is the only lesson that cannot
 * be taught while the player is also being asked to survive.
 *
 * Three rules it is built to:
 *
 *   1. IT IS NOT A PAGE. There is no OK button, no dialog, nothing to dismiss.
 *      The player leaves it by doing the thing — see `steerOnly` and the
 *      movement clock in `GameScene`. A tutorial you can click past is a
 *      tutorial that teaches clicking past tutorials.
 *   2. IT NEVER EATS THE GESTURE. `pointer-events: none` all the way down, so
 *      the finger that is learning to steer is steering, not being intercepted
 *      by the thing explaining steering.
 *   3. IT SHOWS THE PLAYER'S OWN DEVICE. A finger that swipes on touch, a
 *      pointer that glides on desktop. The wrong glyph reads as a game built
 *      for somebody else.
 *
 * The squad stays lit underneath: the scrim is a ring, not a sheet, so the one
 * thing the player is being asked to look at is the one thing not dimmed.
