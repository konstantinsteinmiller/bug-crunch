/**
 * The on-screen control primer.
 *
 * A crowd runner has exactly one control and three ideas, and a player who
 * doesn't discover them in the first fifteen seconds bounces. So each hint is
 * explicit, phrased for the input device the player actually has, and it
 * retires itself the moment the action is performed — nagging a competent
 * player is its own kind of failure.
 *
 *   move    — the only control there is
 *   gate    — why you would ever stand still
 *   crate   — why you would ever go out of your way
 *   rate    — the second crate type, and the one nobody works out alone
 *   trap    — the red gates take survivors away
 *   divider — the pillar between two gates is lethal, and that is the whole
 *             reason a gate bank is a decision
 *   boss    — the one thing that can kill a big crowd instantly
 *   guard   — the boss's phase shield, which is the one moment in the game
 *             where the player's fire deliberately stops working. Without a
 *             word for it, "my bullets do nothing" reads as a bug.
 *   lever   — the weapon puzzle. The only hint here for a thing that is purely
 *             a BONUS: every other lesson in this list is something that will
 *             otherwise cost the player survivors, and this one costs them
 *             nothing at all. It is here because a beat with no consequence for
 *             missing it is a beat the road can never teach on its own.
 *   cage    — the rescue cage, on exactly the lever's terms and for exactly the
 *             lever's reason. It also carries a second job the lever's does
 *             not: a cage looks enough like a supply crate from a distance that
 *             "another box" is the default reading, so the hint has to say what
 *             is DIFFERENT about it rather than what it is.
 *   shieldBox
 *           — the auto-shield pickup, same again. Its specific misreading is
 *             the opposite one: the player already owns a shield with a three
 *             second timer, so the word "shield" alone would promise them the
 *             wrong object. The hint's load-bearing word is *waits*.
