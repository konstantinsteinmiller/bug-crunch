 *   SQUAD   — how many of you there are. The number the whole game is about,
 *             and now the only stat on the strip — it tints green when the
 *             crowd grows and red when it shrinks (see `squadMove`).
 *   RAIL    — how far through the stage you are, with the boss skull at the end
 *
 * During the boss fight the rail turns into the boss's health, because at that
 * point "how far along am I" and "how dead is it" are the same question.
 *
 * The strip carried three more chips until a first-contact playtest — damage,
 * fire rate, and the streak flame. They are gone; the argument is on the

 * life sliding silently upward. When the crowd crosses a rung of the doubling
 * ladder (25, 50, 100, 200, 400 …; the rule and the reasoning live in
 * `squadMilestones.ts`) the chip takes a hit, a chime plays once, and a small
 * gold word appears under it for a beat.
 *
 * It lives HERE rather than in the simulation because it is a readout event,
 * not a game event: nothing about the run changes, and the sim has no business
 * knowing that a number looks round to a human. The HUD already receives every
 * input the decision needs.
 *
 * ─── Where the run resets ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two signals, because neither alone covers both ways a run begins, and the
 * cost of the two mistakes is not symmetric: failing to re-arm costs a player
 * the early chimes of one run, while re-arming inside a run replays the whole
 * ladder — which is exactly the bug this feature is most likely to ship with.
 * So both signals are the CONSERVATIVE reading of "a run ended".
 *
 *   phase 'clear' | 'wipe' → 'run'   `startStage` is the only place a run
 *     begins and the last thing it does is set `phase` back to `'run'`. Coming
 *     from a FINISHED run is the part that matters: `'boss'` → `'run'` is not
 *     spelled here, because a boss fight is the middle of a run and a future
 *     path out of one must not be read as a new run.
 *   stage number changes   the retry case's opposite. `retryStage` repeats the
 *     number (so the phase edge above is what catches it), and a mode that
 *     jumps stages without passing through a result screen — the daily
 *     expedition does — changes the number without one.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT a signal: the squad reaching zero. That is a wipe
 * AND a rally, and a rally is the one moment in the game where the player is
 * handed something for free — re-announcing 25, 50 and 100 on top of it would
 * turn a reprieve into a slot machine.

/**
 * ─── Which way the crowd just moved ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same playtest that killed the other three chips found that nobody read
 * this one as a COUNT OF PEOPLE either — it was a number beside a glyph, and a
 * number beside a glyph is what the other three were. The glyph is redrawn as a
 * crowd (`iconPaths.ts`), and the chip now says which way that crowd is going:
 * green while it grows, red while it shrinks. A player who has learnt nothing
 * else still learns "red is bad, and it happens when I touch that" inside one
 * stage, which is the whole lesson the HUD is there to teach.
 *
 * ─── Why this is a LATCH and not a watcher ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `squad` moves several times a second — a gate bank pays out in per-frame
 * increments, a boss sweep takes bodies the same way — so a tint driven
 * directly off the prop would strobe, and a queue of tints would still be
 * playing the payout back after the payout had ended. So:
 *
 *   • the DIRECTION is latched and the tint is held for a fixed window;
 *   • another change the same way only EXTENDS the window (a 40-frame payout is
 *     one continuous green, not forty flashes);
 *   • a change the other way is dropped rather than queued — the run has moved
 *     on by the time a queue would drain, and the next real change re-tints
 *     within a frame anyway;
 *   • except that a LOSS always interrupts a gain. Red outranks green because
 *     the two mistakes do not cost the same: a gain the player missed costs
 *     them nothing, and a loss they missed is how they arrive at the result
 *     screen with no idea what hit them. A payout that was still running paints
 *     itself green again on its very next increment.
 *
 * It tints the ICON and nothing else: no size, no position, no margin. The chip
 * is already animated on its own axis (the milestone punch scales the whole
 * plate) and two animations on one box fight each other — this one rides on
 * `color` and a drop-shadow, which cannot move the row it is in even by a
 * subpixel. A reduced-motion preference therefore has nothing to switch off
 * here: the cue is a colour, not a movement, and this file's position on that
 * (see the punch's still variant) is that feedback survives the preference.

//
// The squad glyph, tinted for a beat in the direction the crowd just moved
// (`squadMove` carries the rule and the coalescing). Why it is two properties on
// the icon rather than a keyframe on the chip:
//
//   • neither `color` nor `filter` can affect layout, so the tint cannot nudge
//     the stage column or the wallet beside it — the row is the same shape in
//     every frame of it;
//   • the chip's own punch (below) owns `scale` and `box-shadow`, and two
//     animations on one box is how a chip ends up parked mid-scale the first
//     time one of them is interrupted;
//   • there is no animation to RESTART, which is the trap the punch needs a
//     re-keyed node to get out of. A held class cannot fall out of step with
//     the state that set it.
//
// It arrives hard and leaves soft: `transition: none` on the two tinted states
// makes adding the class a cut, and removing it falls back to the rule above,
// which fades. A tint that faded IN read as the number drifting rather than as
// something happening to it.
//
// The two colours are also far apart in LIGHTNESS, not just in hue: green and
// red are the one pair of signal colours a red-green colour-blind player cannot
// separate, and roughly half this game's audience is eight years old with
// nobody to ask. Desaturate these two to grey and the gain is still the pale one.

// Pure CSS, restarted by re-keying the element (see `announceMilestone`) — the
// alternative, a JS loop writing a scale every frame, would put a layout write
// on the main thread during the exact frame a `×3` door is spawning four
// hundred particles.
//
// It overshoots and comes back rather than easing in: a chip that swells
// smoothly reads as a transition, and a chip that is HIT reads as an event. The
// gold rim is the same `#ffd93c` the ladder chip and the best-stage line use, so
// the colour already means "something good" everywhere else in this HUD.
