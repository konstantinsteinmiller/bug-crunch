/**
 * ─── The between-stages banner ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What the early stages use INSTEAD of a result screen.
 *
 * A cleared stage used to stop the game: music down, overlay up, statistics, a
 * button. That is the right shape for a player who has decided to stay and is
 * choosing what to buy — and the wrong shape at twenty-five seconds, where it
 * reads as an ending to someone who has not decided anything yet. Measured, half
 * of Poki's testers left at exactly that screen.
 *
 * So the opening stages hand over without stopping. The road keeps moving, the
 * music keeps playing, and this rides over the top of the next stage's empty
 * opening — which is already fifteen units of nothing by design, so it costs no
 * gameplay at all. It is deliberately not dismissable and deliberately has no
 * button: there is nothing to decide here, which is the entire point.
 *
 * It carries one of two things under the stage number: what the player has
 * JUST been handed (`unlock`), or what is coming NEXT (`next`) — the ladder in
 * `game/ladder.ts`. A stranger who reads "next: choose a weapon" on the stage-2
 * banner has a reason to reach stage 3 that a coin total never gave them.
 *
 * `title` overrides the stage line for the one other announcement that rides
 * this banner: the rally.
