/**
 * ─── The glyph vocabulary ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One flat, closed list of every icon the UI can draw. It lives in its own
 * module rather than inside `GameIcon.vue` so a component can import the *type*
 * (`GameIconName`) for a prop without pulling the SFC — and, more importantly,
 * so a typo in a call site is a compile error instead of a silently blank
 * button.
 *
 * The redesign replaced most button captions with glyphs, which makes this list
 * load-bearing: `next` is no longer the word "Next", it is `skip-forward`.
