  //- ─── The greeting ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //-
  //- What used to be here was Tower Siege's: three stacked blocks pulsing in
  //- sequence, carried over with the splash flow along with its wordmark. A
  //- loading spinner tells a first-time player nothing except that they are
  //- waiting, and the splash is the ONE moment every player sees before they
  //- decide whether to stay.
  //-
  //- So it is a joke instead. The wispling — the game's lantern ghost, painted
  //- through the art pipeline, its walk cycle already on disk — floats out,
  //- shouts BOO, and then immediately cracks up at its own prank. Cute, not
  //- spooky: the point is to buy sympathy for the cast in the two seconds
  //- before the game starts, and a monster that scares you and then giggles is
  //- a monster you do not mind meeting again.
  //-
  //- The composition is a greeting card — ghost and bubble on top, the title
  //- under both — and it is duplicated (ghost + logo, no bubble) as the inline
  //- static splash in `index.html`, so the handover from static HTML to this
  //- component is one continuous picture with the bubble popping in on top of
  //- it rather than a swap between two different screens.

// that finishes pops behind it and is simply never seen. This is that fade plus
// a small margin — the least the shout can wait and still be visible.
//
// It stays that short because the whole gag has to fit inside a load. The laugh

// GameMonetize QA, 2026-09-09: "Ads should be shown the first time after the
// game loads." That ad was served by `useFirstStartInterstitial`, awaited in
// `GameScene.boot()`, and it SAMPLES `isInterstitialReady` exactly once — which
// makes the placement a race it loses on a real portal:
//
//   * `boot()` runs from `onMounted` on the lazily-imported GameScene route
//     chunk — a local, modulepreloaded file.
//   * The ad SDK is only injected by `initAds()`, called AFTER `app.mount()`
//     returns (`main.ts`), and does not report ready until
//     api.gamemonetize.com has loaded and its ad stack has initialised.
//
// So the game's own chunk beats a cross-origin ad SDK, `isInterstitialReady` is
// false at the one moment that module looks, and it deliberately does not burn
// its one-shot when not ready — waiting for a retry that cannot come, because
// `boot()` runs once per session. No ad, no error, nothing logged.
//
// It stayed hidden because BOTH proofs were run against an SDK with no network
// in front of it: the unit suite hands the module a ready ref, and the portal-QA
// stub answered SDK_READY in 30 ms, so locally the SDK won the race every time.
// (`scripts/portal-qa.mjs` now delays that handshake for this reason.)
//
// This orchestrator has no such race: it WATCHES readiness and fires on the
// first moment the splash is gone AND the SDK reports a fillable interstitial,
// however long the SDK takes to come up.
//
// GameDistribution is deliberately NOT armed here. Its post-splash ad was
// removed for producing borderline-incidental-click impressions (the player taps
// "play" expecting the game and lands on an ad) and GD moderation has not asked
// for it back — re-arming it is a product decision, not a bug fix.

//
// `wispling.webp` is the painted walk cycle the field already plays: one
// horizontal strip of 8 panels, each 228 x 256. The window shows one panel and
// the strip inside it is 8x as wide, so a `steps(8)` slide of exactly -100% of
// the STRIP's own width lands on each panel in turn — no pixel arithmetic, and
// it stays correct if the strip is ever repainted at a different resolution.
//
// The panel count IS hard-coded here, unlike `spriteStrip.ts` which reads it
// off the file. CSS cannot measure an image; a repaint with a different panel
// count has to change the 8 in three places (here, the strip width, and the
// static splash). That is the trade for animating this without a frame of JS.
//
// A panel is the FIELD's frame box, and that box reserves headroom for the
// tall monsters — the wispling only fills the middle of it. Measured off the
// file, its ink runs 0.206..0.789 across a panel and 0.363..0.941 down it, so
// a window sized to the panel shows a ghost barely half as big as the space it
// occupies, floating oddly high. The three numbers below are therefore solved
// for the INK rather than the box:
//
//   ink is 0.583 x 0.578 of a panel, its centre 0.4975 across
//   want:  ink 76% of the stage tall, centred at 29% across, bottom at 98% down
//   so:    window height = 0.76 / 0.578            = 131.5% of the stage
//          window width  = that x (228/256) x (200/340) = 68.9% of the stage

// The logo file is the PWA's 512 icon, so the wordmark sits inside a mostly
// transparent square — measured, its ink runs from y=216 to y=295 of 512. Shown
// square it would push the percentage off a landscape phone, so the window
// crops to a band around the ink: 0.398..0.600 of the file's height, which is
// the ink plus a little air.
//
// The offset is a percentage MARGIN, which resolves against the containing
// block's WIDTH — the same number the image is scaled to — so the crop holds at
// every size without a media query.

// Motion is the whole point here, so this cannot be a blanket `animation: none`

// hanging beside it. Instead the jump SCARE goes (no lunge, no shake, no
// overshoot) and the gentle float and the frame cycle stay, which is the beat
// somebody who asked for less motion was asking to lose.
