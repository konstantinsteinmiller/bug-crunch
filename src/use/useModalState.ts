// ─── UI modal-open signal ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tracks how many blocking FModal dialogs (the Locker, Settings, the
// Leaderboard, the result screen) are currently open, and HALTS THE SIMULATION
// while any of them is up.
//
// The pause is not cosmetic. Every one of these is opened mid-level — the
// Locker in particular is where a player goes to answer the bug that is beating
// them — and letting the clock run and the board fill while they read a panel
// punishes them for using the game's own systems. It also makes the CrazyGames
// contract honest: `gameplayStop()` is meant to mean gameplay actually stopped,
// not that a panel happens to be covering it.
//
// Two separate signals come out of this, deliberately:
//   * `isAnyModalOpen` — the SDK-event signal, consumed by the gameplay
//     lifecycle driver in `GameScene`.
//   * an app pause from `useGamePause` — the simulation + audio gate.
//
// Refcounted so overlapping / stacked modals compose: gameplay only resumes
// once the LAST modal closes. `acquireModalOpen()` returns a release function
// the caller (FModal) invokes on close / unmount.
