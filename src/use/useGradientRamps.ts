// ─── Cached gradient ramps ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `createLinearGradient` / `createRadialGradient` are not free. Each call
// allocates a gradient object, and every `addColorStop` after it parses a CSS
// colour string and re-sorts the stop list; the ramp itself is then rasterised
// into a lookup texture the first time it is painted. Doing that once for a
// backdrop is nothing. Doing it once PER ENTITY PER FRAME is a different thing:
// the particle pool alone is 900 slots, and every smoke puff in it was building
// a fresh two-stop radial ramp — plus two template literals to describe it —
// sixty times a second.
//
// The ramps themselves almost never actually differ. A muzzle flash is the same
// three colours at the same radius for all 190 survivors on screen; every coin
// glow is the same ramp at a different position; every smoke puff of a given
// colour is the same ramp at a different size. So they are built once and kept.
//
// ── The rule that makes this safe ──
//
// A `CanvasGradient` stores its coordinates as plain numbers and resolves them
// against the transform in effect AT PAINT TIME, not at creation time. That is
// what makes a cached ramp reusable: build it in local space — centred on the
// origin, or on a fixed offset from it — and then place it with `translate` and
// size it with `scale` at each call site. The same object then paints correctly
// at two hundred different positions.
//
// The corollary is the trap: a ramp built at absolute screen coordinates
// (`createRadialGradient(sx, sy, ...)`) is pinned to one spot and cannot be
// cached at all, because `sx`/`sy` move every frame. Converting such a site is
// therefore always TWO changes — cache the ramp, and push the position into the
// transform — and the second half is where the pixels can shift if the geometry
// is transcribed carelessly. Non-uniform `scale` in particular squashes the
// gradient as well as the path, which is only correct if the original gradient
// was squashed too.
//
// ── Alpha ──
//
// Ramps whose only per-entity variation is opacity are stored at FULL opacity
// and modulated with `globalAlpha` at the call site. This is exact rather than
// approximate: canvas interpolates gradient stops in premultiplied-alpha space,
// so a ramp from `rgba(c, a)` to `rgba(c, 0)` and the same ramp from
// `rgba(c, 1)` to `rgba(c, 0)` under `globalAlpha = a` produce identical pixels.
// (It also means the RGB of a fully transparent end stop is irrelevant — it
// premultiplies to zero — which is why the ramps below drop it.)

// not care how many colour stops the ramp had.
//
// Measured, not assumed. Interleaved A/B over CDP against a headed Chrome 152,
// 150 puffs (the realistic peak for this game's emitters) on a 412x915 DPR-2
// viewport, work-per-frame inside `drawParticles`:
//
//   unthrottled   median-of-rep p95   1.20 ms -> 0.70 ms   (-42%, B won 5/5 reps,
//                                                           ranges disjoint)
//   4x CPU        median-of-rep p50   5.85 ms -> 3.55 ms   (-39%, B won 6/6 reps)
//
// Worth knowing what this does NOT buy: the RAF interval stayed at ~17 ms in
// both arms, so the game was vsync-capped either way. This is frame-budget
// headroom on a weak device, not a frame-rate change at that workload.
//
// The size of a puff is carried by `drawImage`'s destination rectangle. It must
// NOT be carried by a `scale()` transform — see `PERF-LEDGER.md`, where sizing a
// cached unit ramp that way is recorded as the approach this replaced.
//
// Sprites are square, with the ramp's centre at the middle and its last stop
// reaching the edge, so the corners are transparent and the blit is a drop-in
// for a filled `arc` of the same radius.

/**
 * Source radius in pixels, chosen against the largest puff the game can draw.
 *
 * `setViewport` caps the camera at `usableH / VIEW_HEIGHT`, so `scale` tops out
 * near 105 on a 4K display; the biggest smoke emitter asks for `0.5 * scale`,
 * which is a ~53 px CSS radius, or ~105 device pixels once the DPR cap of 2 is
 * applied. At 96 the sprite is therefore downscaled on every phone and roughly
 * 1:1 on the largest desktop — never meaningfully upscaled.
 *
 * That matters less than it looks, since a radial ramp carries no high-frequency
 * detail for a resample to lose, but the memory is cheap enough not to gamble:
 * 192x192 RGBA is ~147 kB, and the palette in play is a handful of colours.
