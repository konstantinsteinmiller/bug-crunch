/**
 * ─── Sharing a best run ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The result screen offers a picture of a record run to whatever the device
 * calls "share". This module owns two things and nothing else: WHETHER that
 * offer may exist at all, and what happens when it is taken. The picture
 * itself lives in `@/game/shareCardArt` and is loaded on the tap — a share
 * card is a rare, late interaction and has no business on the boot path, so
 * nothing here imports the renderer statically.
 *
 * ─── The rule this file exists to enforce ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NEVER SHOW A BUTTON THAT CANNOT WORK. A share affordance that does nothing
 * is worse than no affordance: the player taps it, nothing happens, and the
 * game is broken. On a portal that is also a QA rejection.
 *
 * The reason that is hard is the iframe. Every portal we ship to runs the game
 * cross-origin inside one, and Web Share is a permissions-policy-gated feature:
 * `navigator.share` EXISTS in that frame and `navigator.canShare({files})` can
 * happily answer `true`, and the call still rejects with `NotAllowedError`
 * because the parent document never wrote `allow="web-share"` on the iframe.
 * There is no synchronous test that settles it on every engine. So this file
 * gates in three layers:
 *
 *   1. the API has to be there, AND it has to accept a FILE (the two are
 *      separate features — Web Share level 1 has no files at all);
 *   2. the permissions policy, where the browser will answer the question
 *      (`document.permissionsPolicy` / the older `featurePolicy`) — this is
 *      what removes the button before the first dead tap in the common case;
 *   3. and the first refusal at runtime demotes the whole feature for the rest
 *      of the session, because a frame that refused once will refuse again.
 *
 * ─── The download fallback ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Saving the card as a file instead is only offered on a build that is NOT a
 * portal build and is not framed by anyone. Portals forbid it at three
 * independent levels — the sandbox on their iframe usually omits
 * `allow-downloads` (the download is dropped silently, which is the exact dead
 * button this file exists to prevent), several of them forbid navigating or
 * handing the player a file out of the game as a store rule, and Poki forbids
 * everything that leaves the frame outright. None of that is worth a per-portal
 * table that would be wrong the first time a portal changed its wrapper: if the
 * build has a platform flag, there is no download.

 * whole chain collapses to a single `true`/`false` per build and the download
 * branch below is dead code the bundler removes — the posture
 * `platforms/capabilities.ts` documents at length. The second is that
 * `useUser` drags the save layer and the IndexedDB bootstrap in behind it, and
 * a module whose entire job is to decide whether one button exists should be
