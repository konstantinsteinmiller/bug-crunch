/**
 * ─── splatix audio ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two sources, one entry point (`playFx`):
 *
 *   SAMPLES   — where a recorded sound is unmistakably better: coin pickup,
 *               stage-clear fanfare, the wipe sting. These route through the
 *               shared `useSound` fast path (decoded AudioBuffers).
 *   SYNTHESIS — the whole combat layer. A crowd of forty fires ~46 shots a
 *               second; sample playback of one file at that rate sounds like a
 *               machine gun jam, and shipping forty variants would bloat the
 *               download. Shots, impacts, gate ticks and bursts are synthesised
 *               per event with randomised pitch and envelope, so no two are
 *               identical and the combat mix costs zero bytes.
 *
 * The gate tick is the one cue the whole game is built around, so it gets
 * special treatment: its pitch RISES with the gate's value. Pumping a gate from
 * +1 to +12 plays an ascending scale, which is why holding fire on a gate feels
 * like winding something up rather than waiting.
 *
 * Everything runs on the SHARED AudioContext from `useAssets`, which the ad /
 * pause gate suspends — so "no game audio during an ad" covers synthesised
 * sound for free: a suspended context produces silence.

       * sounded like a cleared stage in the middle of a stage would tell the
       * player the run had ended, which is the one thing a juice cue must never
       * say. The fourth (`win`) is a full mix with its own key and a ~1.5 s
       * reverb tail — and this cue lands on the SAME FRAME as a gate pass,
       * because passing a door is the only way a squad ever crosses a round
       * number, so it has to sit ON TOP of the `gatePass` / `gateMul` chord
       * rather than argue with it.
       *
       * So: three notes of the game's OWN pentatonic ladder (`tickFreq`, the
       * gate-pump scale), an octave above the reward chord's register where
       * nothing else in the mix lives, with a quiet third partial for a bell
       * edge and a short upward shimmer under it. It is recognisably the same
       * instrument the player just pumped the door with, which is the point —
       * the milestone reads as that pump paying off, not as a second event.
       *
       * `power` is the RUNG (0 = 25, 1 = 50, 2 = 100 …), not a 0..1 intensity:
       * the phrase starts that far up the ladder, so 800 arrives brighter and
       * higher than 25 did instead of the game chiming the same three notes at
       * a player whose crowd has grown thirty-fold.
