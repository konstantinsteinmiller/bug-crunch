 * ─── Renderer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything is Canvas 2D. The only bitmaps in the whole game are the frame
 * strips baked at runtime from the ink-art vocabulary (`heroSprites`,
 * `monsterSprites`) — so the download carries no gameplay art at all, the game
 * is crisp at every DPR, and first paint happens the moment the bundle parses.
 *
 * Layer order (back → front):
 *
 *   1  sky, tinted by the stage's "time of day"
 *   2  far ridges                      (parallax 0.18)
 *   3  dune band                       (parallax 0.42)
 *   4  the lane: scrolling ground tile, rails, rungs
 *   5  ground decals (scorch, craters)
 *   6  coins → crates → barricades → gates → divider pillars
 *   7  foes, boss
 *   8  survivors + muzzle flashes
 *   9  tracers (additive)
 *  10  particles (normal pass, then additive pass)
 *  11  floating text, off-screen miniboss marker, then full-screen grades:
 *      speed lines, flash, elite flare, vignette
 *
 * The divider pillars sit ON TOP of the gate leaves on purpose. They are the
 * only lethal thing inside the gate band, and a lethal thing that can be
 * occluded by the pretty thing next to it is a bug, not a layer choice.
 *
 * The camera is deliberately dumb: a fixed frame that fits the lane's width and
 * keeps the crowd at 72% down the screen. A runner does not want a camera with
 * opinions — the player is steering something at the bottom of the screen and
 * reading something at the top, and anything that moves that relationship makes
 * the game harder to read for no gain.

 * and the whole thing is red and dirty where the others are bright and clean.
 * Reversed flow is the cheapest "do not enter" signal there is: it works at any

 * "not here" to say. So it is drawn as what it is: a band spanning the road
 * from the elite's feet back `ELITE_SWEEP_REACH` — the exact distance the kill
 * is measured against — with a bright edge travelling across it in the
 * direction the arc will swing. Nothing about it suggests a gap to stand in,
 * because there is not one, and a telegraph that implied one would teach a
 * dodge that gets the squad killed.
 *
 * It has 0.3 s to be understood, which is why it is a filled band and not an
 * outline: at this length the read has to be pre-attentive.
 *
 * Drawn UNDER every body, in its own pass, for the same reason the boss's is —
 * a telegraph a monster can stand on top of is not a telegraph — and then a
 * SECOND time over the crowd with `overCrowd`. The ground pass alone is
 * invisible in the only situation the attack exists for: measured in the
 * browser at stage 4, a pinned crowd is 1.65 units of packed bodies sitting
 * exactly where the warning is drawn. The overlay is the same band at the same
 * coordinates and the same reach, outline-only, so it reads as the band showing
 * through the crowd rather than as a second, larger threat.
