/**
 * ─── Reward gating ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A perk is paid for with a rewarded video on every build that HAS one, and is
 * simply free on every build that does not.
 *
 * It used to read `isCrazyWeb && isCrazyGamesFullRelease`, which was written
 * when CrazyGames was the only portal wired for rewarded ads. It is now wrong
 * in the expensive direction: Playgama, GamePix, GameMonetize, Yandex and
 * GameDistribution all resolve real providers, so that predicate was handing
 * out every rewarded perk for free on five shipping portals — the ad never
 * played, the placement never earned, and a reviewer clicking a button marked
 * with a video icon saw no video.
 *
 * The rule is now the honest one: is a real provider resolved?
 *
 *   • any real provider  → gated, the video plays.
 *   • CG PRE-release     → NOT gated, and nothing is OFFERED either. See
 *                          `isCrazyPreRelease` below.
 *   • noop (local dev,
 *     plain web, itch…)  → not gated, perks are free.

 * play before approval, and it has NO ad inventory: `requestAd` resolves without
 * ever showing a video.
 *
 * That leaves a rewarded surface with two possible behaviours, and both are QA
 * findings. Gated, the player taps a button marked with a film-frame icon and no
 * video plays. Ungated — which is what `isRewardGated` above resolves to here —
 * the ×3 pays out for free, so the reviewer sees the game hand over its entire
 * run income for a button press.
 *
 * So on this build the offer is not made at all: `canOfferReward` is false, the
 * result screen never renders the button, `rewardWasOffered` stays false (so
 * leaving the screen is not recorded as a decline — the player declined
 * nothing), and `claimReward` refuses outright. Build-time constants, so Rollup
 * folds the whole branch away on every other build.

// the network a call, and not counting it would let a player farm no-fills.

/**
 * Minimum gap between interstitials, ms.
 *
 * 121 s, not 120. CrazyGames and Playgama both rate-limit interstitials to one
 * every two minutes and REJECT the request that arrives early — so a gate set
 * to exactly the platform's own limit loses the race to clock skew, timer
 * coalescing in a background tab, or the few milliseconds between our check and
 * the SDK's. The extra second costs nothing and turns a rejected request into a
 * filled one.
 *
 * ─── Why one number and not a per-platform table ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pacing is time-based on EVERY build — not keyed to stages or waves — so
 * the only thing that could vary per portal is the length of the gap. Walking
 * the shipped targets, 121 s is the maximum of every documented minimum, so a
 * table would today hold nine identical entries:
 *
 *   • CrazyGames  — one midgame ad per 2 min; an early request is rejected.
 *   • Playgama    — Bridge's own `minimumDelayBetweenInterstitial` is 120 s.
 *   • Yandex      — ≥ 60 s apart, and none in the first 60 s after load. 121 s
 *                   satisfies both, and the "first call starts the clock"
 *                   behaviour below covers the post-load half.
 *   • Poki        — paced server-side; the SDK's own bad-event gate is the only
 *                   client-side limit and it is about event SPACING, not ads.
 *   • GamePix / GameDistribution / GameMonetize — frequency-capped inside the
 *                   SDK, with published guidance of one interstitial every
 *                   2-3 min. 121 s is the floor, their cap is the ceiling.
 *
 * If a portal ever publishes a LONGER minimum, raise it here for that build
 * rather than reintroducing a stage counter — a stage-keyed cadence drifts with
 * how fast the player is, which is exactly what the portals' rules are not.
