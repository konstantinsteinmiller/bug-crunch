// ─── Gameplay-bracket fan-out ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One place that answers "is the player actually playing right now?" for every
// portal that wants to know. `GameScene.vue` reports the boolean; this module
// decides which SDK events that becomes, because WHICH events to send is a
// platform contract and not a view concern.
//
// Previously `GameScene.vue` imported `syncGameplayLifecycle` straight from
// `useCrazyGames`, which made CrazyGames the implicit owner of a signal two
// portals now need. The indirection is one hop and keeps the scene unaware of
// how many platforms are listening.
//
// ⚠️ POKI: the caller drives this from `watch(isLiveGameplay, …)`, and
// `isLiveGameplay` is a computed over five reactive inputs — so a modal closing
// in the same tick an ad opens emits a stop→start pair microseconds apart. On
// CrazyGames that is merely noisy. On Poki it is monetization-fatal: the core
// SDK counts a `gameplayStart()` landing within 50 ms of the preceding
// `gameplayStop()` as a "bad event", and at 10 of them `gameplayStart`,
// `gameplayStop` AND `commercialBreak` all become no-ops for the rest of the
// session, reported only through a debug log line. `pokiGameplayStart/Stop`
// collapse duplicate consecutive events and defer (never drop) a start that
// lands inside the guard window, which is what makes this call site safe.
//
// The import is STATIC on purpose: this file is not in the obfuscator's exclude
// list, so a dynamic `'@/…'` literal would be at the mercy of the `stringArray`
// rewrite. The PokiSDK URL is kept out of every other platform's bundle by the
// `resolve.alias` stub swap in `vite.config.ts`, not by the env-literal gate
// below — see `pokiPlugin.stub.ts` for why the gate alone is not enough.
