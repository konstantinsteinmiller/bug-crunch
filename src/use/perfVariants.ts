// ─── Boot-frozen performance variant flags ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The A/B seam for performance experiments. See `PERF-LEDGER.md` for the
// procedure and for every experiment this project has run.
//
// ── Why the flag is frozen at boot ──
//
// Resolved ONCE, here, at module load. A flag that re-read `localStorage` or
// parsed the URL on each access would itself land in the hot loop it is meant
// to measure, and the two arms would then differ by more than the change under
// test. Read it as a `const` at module scope; never inside a per-frame call.
//
// ── Running an experiment ──
//
//   1. Add a flag below naming the BASELINE arm — `<thing>-legacy`, not
//      `<thing>-new`. The shipping path must be what you get with no flag set,
//      so a stray query string can never turn a player's game into an
//      experiment.
//   2. Branch at the COARSEST level that isolates the change (swap the emitter,
//      not each particle) so the check never lands in an inner loop.
//   3. Keep the baseline path exactly as it was. Tidying it up while you are in
//      there contaminates the comparison.
//   4. Measure: `pnpm perf:ab --a "perf=<thing>-legacy" --b ""`.
//   5. Record the verdict in `PERF-LEDGER.md`, then DELETE the losing branch
//      and its flag. Shipping both paths forever is how a dead branch rots and
//      a flag ends up in a hot loop.
//
// Select with `?perf=<name>` on the URL, or
// `localStorage.setItem('perf', '<name>')`. Comma-separate to combine.
// With nothing set, every experiment resolves to its SHIPPING value, so this
// file costs one string read at boot and nothing else in production.

const raw = (() => {
  try {
    const fromUrl = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('perf')
    if (fromUrl) return fromUrl
    return localStorage.getItem('perf') ?? ''
  } catch {
    // Private mode can throw on `localStorage`, and there is no `window` under
    // SSR or in a worker. An experiment seam must never be the thing that
    // breaks a boot.
    return ''

 * Baseline for the squish-juice pass: no goo droplets (the shape-4 teardrops a
 * burst throws), no flattened body ghost, and the boss death back to one ring.
 *
 * Branched at the emitter, not per particle: `gooSpray` and `pushSquash` return
 * immediately, and `bossDeath` takes its old three-line path — so the flag is
 * read once at module scope and the check never lands in a per-particle loop.
 *
 * This one is a FEATURE with a cost rather than an optimization, so the verdict
 * it is measured against is a budget ("does the new juice cost a throttled phone
 * frames?") and not a win. See `PERF-LEDGER.md`.
