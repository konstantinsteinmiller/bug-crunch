// ─── Analytics — the funnel the portal bracket cannot see ───────────────────
//
// `useGameplayLifecycle` tells every portal HOW LONG and HOW OFTEN somebody
// played. It cannot tell anyone WHERE they stopped, and "where" is the only
// question the retention roadmap is actually asking: a career that ends at
// stage 7 on a barricade and one that ends at stage 7 on a boss slam are two
// different bugs with two different fixes, and the bracket reports both as
// "one play, four minutes".
//
// So this module owns a second, finer signal. Six events, named once here and
// nowhere else:
//
//   stage_start   a stage opened          { stage, squad, relieved, challenge }
//   stage_end     a stage was cleared     { stage, peakSquad, kills, durationMs, coins }
//   wipe          a stage ended in a loss { stage, progress01, cause, durationMs }
//   gate_pass     a gate was taken        { op, value, before, after }
//   shop_open     the shop was opened     { coins, affordable, stage }
//   upgrade_buy   a track was bought      { id, level, cost }
//
// ─── What happens to an event ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two sinks, and NEITHER of them is allowed to be load-bearing:
//
//   1. THE RING. The last `RING` events are kept in memory and readable through
//      `analyticsLog()` — and, in debug, through `window.__analytics`. That is
//      what makes the wiring testable and what a QA session actually reads on a
//      device. It dies with the tab, on purpose: this game stores no telemetry
//      about anybody.
//   2. THE PORTAL. Whichever host page offers a generic event sink gets a copy.
//      Portals differ wildly here — most of the SDKs we ship against have no
//      custom-event API at all — so the fan-out PROBES rather than assumes, the
//      same way `gamepixPlugin` probes for `happytime`/`happyMoment`. A portal
//      with nothing to call is a silent no-op, which is the correct behaviour
//      and not a failure worth logging.
//
// ⚠️ No SDK module is imported here, and none should be. Every portal plugin in
// this project is either statically bundled behind an alias stub or dynamically
// imported behind its env flag; an import here would pull one portal's loader
// into every other portal's bundle for the sake of a probe that reads a global
// anyway. `window` is the only surface this module touches.
//
// ⚠️ Never call this from inside the frame loop for anything that happens per
// entity. `gate_pass` is the highest-frequency event in the list and fires a
// handful of times a stage; anything hotter belongs in `deathBreakdown()`.
