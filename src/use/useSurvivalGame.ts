/**
 * ─── Survivalist — the simulation ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A module singleton, deliberately. There is exactly ONE run in flight at a
 * time, the renderer and the HUD both need to read it every frame, and passing
 * a store through props would mean the hot path goes through Vue's reactivity
 * for a hundred and ninety moving bodies. So: reactive refs for the handful of
 * values the HUD actually renders, plain arrays for everything the CANVAS
 * renders, and one `step(dtMs)` that owns the clock.
 *
 * Nothing here draws, measures, or touches the DOM — which is what keeps the
 * whole thing testable in jsdom, and what lets `tests/game/*` and the balance
 * harness walk a stage and assert its shape without a canvas.
 *
 * ─── The four rules that make it a game ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. SOLID THINGS KILL. Every obstacle that has not been destroyed — crates,
 *      barricades, gate dividers — kills whoever runs into it. The gates
 *      themselves are the sole exception; they are doorways, not walls.
 *   2. GATES ARE A COMMITMENT. A bank is two leaves with a lethal pillar
 *      between them, and the crowd is narrower than one leaf but wider than the
 *      gap to the pillar. Choose a side and aim, or pay for the indecision.
 *   3. FIRE RATE IS EARNED IN THE RUN. It starts crawling and only rises from
 *      rate crates, which are always off the straight line.
 *   4. LOSING TEACHES. Die on a stage and every enemy on it loses 20 % health,
 *      once, permanently — a floor under frustration that never becomes a
 *      slide into triviality.
 *
 * ─── The loop, in order ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   steer → advance → stream the track → shoot → move bullets → resolve hits →
 *   gates → dividers → foes → barricades → crates → pickups → boss → win/lose
 *
 * The order matters in one place: gates resolve AFTER movement so a gate can
 * never be "passed" on the same frame its number ticked up — the player always
 * sees the number they collected.

 * ─── Solid strips the formation may not aim into ────────────────────────────

 * four entity scans per unit and the squad cap is four thousand.
 *
 * This exists because of what contact does now. Killing whoever touches a solid
 * thing is the rule; DRAGGING somebody into one who never touched it is not,
 * and the formation does exactly that if left alone. Slots are re-packed the
 * moment anybody dies — that is what closes ranks — so the survivors of a stone
 * are re-slotted across the gap the dead ones left, walked into the same stone,
 * and killed by it in turn. Measured on one boulder rank: geometry says 60 of
 * an 85-strong crowd stand in the column and die, and the sim killed all 85.
 * The extra 25 are the bookkeeping, not the boulder.
 *
 * So a target is not allowed to land inside a solid — with one deliberate
 * exception that is the whole difference between this and the shove it
 * replaced: a survivor ALREADY inside the strip is left exactly where it is.
 * It is touching the stone, so it dies this frame, and it must not be quietly
 * routed around the thing that is killing it. Only survivors standing OUTSIDE
 * are held outside, on the side they are already on.
 *
 * The result is the shape a crowd hitting a rock actually makes: the column
 * that ran into it is deleted, and the two lobes either side of it stream past
 * and close up behind. Nobody slides along the rock face.

 * ─── Solid-body contact ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything that is not a gate is SOLID, and solid means exactly one thing:
 * **whoever touches it dies, and everybody else runs on.** No quota, no rate,
 * no grace period — the survivors on the line that hit the stone are gone, the
 * rest of the swarm flows past on both sides of it.
 *
 * This replaced a rate-plus-shove model, and the reason is what a player saw:
 * the shove meant a crowd driven into a boulder WRAPPED AROUND it and kept
 * going, bodies sliding along the rock and closing up behind it while a trickle
 * of them died to a per-second budget. Two survivors' worth of consequence for
 * an obstacle the whole game calls lethal. "Solid" has to mean solid the first
 * time it is touched, or the road stops teaching anything.
 *
 * Three things follow from the change, and all three are improvements:
 *
 *   • THE COST IS THE LINE YOU RAN, not the seconds you spent. Clip the edge of
 *     a block with a handful of bodies and lose that handful; drive the middle
 *     of the crowd through it and lose the whole column. The old rate charged
 *     nearly the full percentage for a graze, which is precisely backwards.
 *   • THE COST SCALES BY ITSELF. A percentage had to be hand-tuned per obstacle
 *     so it stayed meaningful from a four-strong squad to a four-thousand-strong
 *     one; a column through the crowd is inherently proportional to the crowd,
 *     because it is measured in the crowd's own bodies.
 *   • NOTHING IS CARRIED BETWEEN FRAMES. The old budget banked fractional kills
 *     per obstacle id, which took two bug-fixes to stop it punishing a player
 *     who corrected late four times harder than one who never corrected at all.
 *     A rule with no accumulator cannot have that class of bug.
 *
 * The thing this gives up is the old model's cushion for a stuck player:
 * `contactRelief` scaled the rate, and there is no rate left to scale. Relief
 * now reaches obstacle deaths only through the retry discounts that make the
 * obstacles themselves weaker (`hpRelief`) and the squad bigger.
 *
 * Elites are the one solid thing that does NOT kill on contact — they own their
 * damage through the bite loop, and displace instead (`partAround`).

 * go around:
 *
 *   • a PILLAR is a blade standing between two doors the player is aiming at.
 *     The safe band beside it is half a unit wide, so a lethal pillar makes the
 *     whole game a precision test — measured, it deletes a zero-input run at
 *     67 % of stage 1, on the first bank, which is the documented onboarding
 *     floor ("a player who never touches the screen still reaches the boss").
 *   • a CRATE is a REWARD the player was invited to chase. Punishing the
 *     attempt as hard as a wall teaches them to stop chasing rewards.
 *
 * `crushDebt` carries the fractional part of a kill between frames so a 60 fps
 * device and a 30 fps one cost the player the same. Two rules keep it honest,
 * and both were bugs first: budget accrues only while something is ACTUALLY
 * touching (it used to bank ~2 s of kills on approach and spend the lot on the
 * first frame of contact), and the carry is capped at one kill.

 * ─── A monster's body: half of what hits it dies, the rest bounce off ───────
 *
 * The third contact rule in the game, and it sits deliberately between the

 *
 *   • a WALL takes everyone who touches it (`crushAgainst`) — it stands still,
 *     so the whole cost is the line the player chose;
 *   • a PILLAR grinds at a per-second rate (`grindAgainst`) — the player is
 *     aiming at the doors either side of it;
 *   • a MONSTER takes HALF of what touches it, and the survivors of that get
 *     ten frames where nothing else can hit them.
 *
 * A monster homes on the crowd, so unlike a wall it cannot be steered away
 * from — all-or-nothing contact would be an undodgeable half of the squad, and
 * the balance suite says so out loud (benchmark player dead at 10 % of stage 5,
 * eight invariants broken). Halving keeps the collision a real, visible cost
 * that a run absorbs rather than a verdict it cannot argue with.
 *
 * The i-frames are what make it a COLLISION rather than a rate. Without them a
 * survivor inside a monster is offered to the halving on every one of the sixty
 * frames a second and lasts about three of them; with them, one contact costs
 * one halving and the crowd is untouchable long enough to be pushed clear and
 * steered off. Crucially they are per-SURVIVOR and not per-monster, so walking
 * a crowd through a pack of six costs six collisions rather than the product of
 * them: two monsters standing shoulder to shoulder cannot bill the same body
 * twice in the same instant.
 *
 * The BITE is untouched and does not respect the immunity, because it is not a
 * collision — it is the monster's attack, metered by `biteCd` and capped at
 * `want` survivors, and it reaches further than the body does. The mouth takes
 * what comes near; the body takes half of what runs into it.
 *
 * Three invariants shared with the obstacle push:
 *
 *   • the UNIT moves and the anchor never does, so the player's steering stays
 *     authoritative — a monster shoves the crowd, it does not shove the thumb;
 *   • the shove is clamped to the road, so a body near a rail squeezes the
 *     crowd along the barrier rather than pushing survivors over it;
 *   • a survivor dead-centre breaks its tie on index parity, so a body sitting
 *     on the crowd's centre line parts it into two lobes instead of sweeping

 * Boulders: solid, lethal, and permanent.
 *
 * The same contact channel as every other solid thing — one `crushAgainst`, so

 * a second rule. What it does NOT have is a branch that can delete it. It rolls
 * off the bottom of the road when the crowd is past it and that is the only way
 * it ever leaves.
 *
 * ─── …except a passage rib, which DIVIDES the crowd ─────────────────────────
 *
 * A passage (see `passage()` in the track) is a rib of stone running back down
 * the road from a bank's pillar, splitting the approach into one corridor per
 * door. In the world it is a dozen separate boulders, and billing them one at a
 * time — each of them a wall that kills everything it touches — made the rib a
 * MINCER rather than a divider: measured on stage 8, a crowd that entered the
 * mouth on the centre line went 203 → 0 in a quarter of a second, because every
 * survivor the spring dragged back toward the anchor met the next stone in the
 * line. "Choose a corridor" is a fair thing to ask; "choose a corridor or the
 * run is over, with no frame in which you could see it coming" is not.
 *
 * So the rib is resolved as ONE object, once, and it does what its shape says:
 *
 *   **the crowd is cut on the stone, the side carrying more survivors runs on
 *   down its corridor, and the side carrying fewer is erased.**
 *
 * Three things follow, and all three are why this is the right shape:
 *
 *   • THE WORST CASE IS HALF. Dead-centre is the most a rib can ever take, and
 *     it is exactly the case the old rule took everything for. Clip the mouth
 *     with a tenth of the crowd and lose a tenth — the cost is the line that was
 *     run, which is what every other solid on the road already charges for.
 *   • THE RUN CONTINUES. Whatever the player was steering at, they come out of
 *     the mouth with a crowd inside a corridor, pointed at a door. A passage is
 *     supposed to move the commitment upstream, not end the stage.
 *   • IT SCALES BY ITSELF, being measured in the crowd's own bodies — nothing to
 *     re-tune from a four-strong squad to a four-thousand-strong one.
 *
 * Scattered boulders are untouched. A field is threaded at full width or not at
 * all, and a rock the player was told to go around should keep killing whoever
 * runs into it.
