// ─── The hidden QA interstitial tap ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Thirty taps on the coin badge inside thirty seconds request an interstitial.
//
// It exists because every portal's interstitial is PACED. `canShowInterstitial`
// holds a 121 s gap between ads and the first call of a session only starts the
// clock, so a reviewer checking the things portals grade — does the ad mute the
// music, does it stop the loop, does it land BEFORE the result screen, does the
// music come back on a no-fill — has to play two full minutes for each attempt,
// on a build where the answer might be no. This is the back door that turns
// that into a ten-second job on the bundle they are actually reviewing.
//
// ── Why it is silent ──
//
// No counter, no toast, no glyph. A visible affordance is a feature the player
// can find, and an ad the player can summon is an ad nobody asked for. The tap
// count and the window ARE the secret, and thirty deliberate taps in thirty
// seconds is not a shape a run produces by accident: the badge is a readout
// rather than a control, and the number of times a real session taps it is
// zero. The failure mode of guessing wrong here is one extra ad, which is why
// this is allowed to ship rather than being hidden behind `isDebug` — QA runs
// the same artefact the player gets, and a back door that only opens on a
// debug build cannot be used to test the build being submitted.
//
// ── What it still owes ──
//
// It bypasses the PACING gate deliberately — that is the whole point — and
// obeys every other rule the real placements obey:
//
//   • it seeds the shared clock (`markInterstitialShown`), so the NEXT
//     placement still owes the full 121 s. Without this a tester could hand a
//     portal two interstitials inside the window it rate-limits on, which is
//     the abuse those limits exist to catch;
//   • it restarts the music on `.finally()`, because this placement interrupts
//     a LIVE run. `showMidgameAd` hard-stops the music and clears the play
//     INTENT by design (so nothing can sound under an ad whose promise settles
//     early), and the thing that normally brings it back is the next
//     `startBattleMusic()` on a result screen — minutes away mid-run. Same
//     rule `useFirstLoadInterstitial` follows, for the same reason;
//   • it refuses while an ad is already up, so a tester who keeps tapping
//     cannot stack a second request behind the first.
//
// The pause gate, the audio suspend and the gameplay bracket come free:
// `showMidgameAd` flips `isAdShowing`, which ORs into `isGamePaused` and is one
// of `isGameplayLive`'s inputs, so the portals are told play stopped and told
// again when it resumes.
