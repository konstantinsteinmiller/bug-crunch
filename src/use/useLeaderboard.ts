/**
 * ─── The global board, client side ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE SCORE IS THE HIGHEST STAGE EVER REACHED. Not a run total and not a point
 * count — the game's whole progression is "how deep did you get", so the board
 * is a depth chart and `score` is a small integer that grows by one at a time.
 * `squad` rides along as a second column because two players on stage 40 are
 * not the same player, and the biggest squad is the thing they compare.
 *
 * ONE RULE ABOVE ALL: NOTHING IN HERE MAY EVER THROW, BLOCK OR DELAY A RUN.
 * Every network call is wrapped, every failure is swallowed, every entry point
 * returns a resolved promise. The board is a decoration on a game that works
 * perfectly without it — a dead endpoint, a captive-portal wifi login page
 * answering 200 with HTML, a portal iframe with no network at all, all have to
 * end in "no rank shown" and nothing else. That is why `reportRun` is called
 * with `void` and never awaited at the call site.
 *
 * THE SECOND RULE IS THE QUOTA. This ships on Cloudflare's free tier against a
 * D1 database, and a client that posts at the end of every run would cost one
 * write per ~40 s of play per player. So: read the board at most once per page
 * load, and write ONLY when the player beat their own posted record. See
 * `reportRun`, which is the only function the game itself calls.
