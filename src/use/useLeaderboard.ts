/**
 * ─── The global board, client side ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE SCORE IS THE BEST SINGLE-LEVEL SCORE — `bestScore`, a POINT TOTAL in the
 * hundreds to the low tens of thousands, not a stage number. `squad` is the
 * wire name of the second column and carries `bestLevel`, the deepest level
 * cleared, because two players on the same points total are not the same player
 * and how far they got is the thing they compare.
 *
 * Those two are easy to swap and expensive to swap: the seeded board shipped
 * for a while with a STAGE number in `score`, which made its histogram top out
 * at 40 while every real player posted thousands — so `rankFromDist` found
 * nobody above them and told every Poki and Yandex player they were #1 of
 * 154 331. `scripts/leaderboard-seed.mjs` and its test now pin the distinction.
 *
 * ONE RULE ABOVE ALL: NOTHING IN HERE MAY EVER THROW, BLOCK OR DELAY A RUN.
 * Every network call is wrapped, every failure is swallowed, every entry point
 * returns a resolved promise. The board is a decoration on a game that works
 * perfectly without it — a dead endpoint, a captive-portal wifi login page
 * answering 200 with HTML, a portal iframe with no network at all, all have to
 * end in "no rank shown" and nothing else. That is why `reportRun` is called
 * with `void` and never awaited at the call site.
 *
 * THE SECOND RULE IS THE QUOTA. This ships on Cloudflare's free tier against a
 * D1 database, and a client that posts at the end of every run would cost one
 * write per ~40 s of play per player. So: read the board at most once per page
 * load, and write ONLY when the player beat their own posted record. See
 * `reportRun`, which is the only function the game itself calls.
