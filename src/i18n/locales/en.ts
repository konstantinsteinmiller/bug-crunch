  // bare digit beside the sign. `spent` takes `{time}` = "H:MM" until the next
  // road prints, which is a UTC boundary and therefore NOT midnight for most
  // players — the countdown is what saves them having to know that.
  //
  // `hud` replaces "Stage 16" on the run readout and `title` headlines the
