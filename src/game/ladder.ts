 * What the opening stages hand over, in order, and — the half that matters —
 * what they PROMISE next. A goal two stages ahead is the cheapest reason there
 * is to start the next stage, and until this existed the game had exactly one
 * gift (the shield, on the stage-1 banner) and never once said what was coming.
 *
 *   stage 1 cleared → the boss's launcher, as a reveal (`BOSS_REWARD_STAGE`);
 *                     the HUD chip says: choose a weapon, next stage
 *   stage 2 cleared → the reveal: launcher or gatling, for stage 3
 *   stage 3 cleared → the shield, and the banner says: a weapon on the road at 4
 *   stage 4 cleared → ONE free Frost Nova, a taste of the skill three stages early
 *   stage 4+        → the next puzzle stage, named by the weapon its box holds —
 *                     or the next SKILL, when one opens first (Frost Nova on 7,
 *                     the Decoy Flare on 10)
 *
 * One module so the banner, the HUD chip and the scene cannot disagree about
 * what is next. Pure functions of the stage number, like the road itself.
