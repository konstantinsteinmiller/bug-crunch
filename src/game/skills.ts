/**
 * ─── The two late skills, as rules ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The grenade answers "what is in front of me" and the shield answers "I was
 * wrong about it". These two answer the questions the late game started asking
 * once the bosses gained second verbs and the elites gained tracking attacks:
 *
 *   FROST NOVA   "give me a second" — everything hostile stops, mid-swing,
 *                and the world waits while the player reads it. Unlocked on
 *                stage 7, with one free use handed over after the stage-4
 *                boss so the player has held it before they own it.
 *   DECOY FLARE  "look over there" — a burning flare on a parachute that the
 *                boss, the elites and the bodies on the road all turn to. It
 *                ends in a burst that pays for whatever it gathered. Stage 10.
 *
 * Pure numbers and pure geometry, here, so the simulation, the renderer and
 * the specs read one definition of how long, how far and how hard.

 *

 * to 1.7 s, so the freeze still outlasts the attack the player was about to
 * eat, and the lane charge's band has time to be walked out of. It was 3.5 s
 * and is now a quarter shorter: at three and a half seconds the player could
 * read the whole road, reposition and come back, which made the nova an answer
 * to every situation rather than an escape from one.

 * it lasts — 2.6 s at ×1.5 is about one and a third extra seconds of fire, less

/**
 * ─── What the late skills cost in time ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The grenade and the shield share one thirty-second clock
 * (`SKILL_COOLDOWN_MS`): they are the run's rhythm, pressed most fights. These
 * two are not. Both are strong enough to decide a fight on their own — the nova
 * stops everything mid-swing, the flare takes the whole fight's attention away
 * from the crowd — and on the grenade's clock a stage's boss could be frozen or
 * lured two or three times over, which turned "how do I survive this" into "hold
 * the button again in half a minute".
 *
 * So they are priced as ESCAPE HATCHES: once a fight, near enough, and the
 * player has to choose which fight. The nova waits longest because it is the
 * strictly stronger answer — it works on anything, from any position, where the
 * flare needs somewhere for the fight to be pulled to.
 *
 * Kept here rather than beside the shop's thirty seconds so the two numbers a
 * balance pass touches sit with the rest of what these skills do.

 * screen, so ~14 units are visible ahead at the reference zoom; a little more
