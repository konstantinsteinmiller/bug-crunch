/**
 * ─── Art contract ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * bug-crunch ships with ZERO gameplay bitmaps of its own making: the cast is
 * hand-inked vector art baked to frame strips at runtime, and the floors, the
 * props, the foot and every effect are Canvas 2D. That keeps the download
 * tiny, makes the art crisp at any DPR, and means the game is playable the
 * instant the JS parses.
 *
 * When painted art arrives it drops in with NO renderer change: `spriteFor()`
 * probes `public/images/<folder>/<id>.webp` and, if the image decodes, the
 * renderer blits it instead of drawing. A missing file simply means "keep
 * drawing it". Every path is catalogued by the manifest in `artSheet.ts`,
 * which is also what exports the reference sheets the paintings are made from.
 *
 * ─── The feature flag ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three layers, most specific first:
 *
 *   1. `?art=on` / `?art=off` in the URL — flips it for this device and is
 *      REMEMBERED, so a reload keeps the answer and the param can be dropped.
 *   2. Whatever was remembered from a previous `?art=`.
 *   3. `VITE_ENABLE_ART_OVERRIDES` — the build's default, and the only layer a
 *      portal ever sees.
 *
 * The build default has to stay the floor because a miss is only free for the
 * GAME. CrazyGames' QA console reports every 404 as `Missing resource detected:
 * …/images/bugs/beetle.webp`, one line per drawable, which reads as a
 * broken build to a reviewer. So art is shipped off until it is ready, while a
 * URL param still lets it be switched on and — the point of the flag — straight
 * back OFF, live, with no rebuild, when the new art turns out worse than the
 * drawn version.
 *
 * Read as a plain boolean rather than a `ref`: `spriteFor` runs per drawable
 * per frame, and a reactive read in that loop costs dependency tracking on every
 * body on the road for a value that changes when a human clicks something.
