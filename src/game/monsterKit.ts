 * front-facing biped needs: get the sign backwards and both knees swing across
 * the centre line, and the character walks with its legs crossed.
 *
 * **Sizing the bones matters as much as the sign.** The knee is thrown
 * sideways by `sqrt(l² − (d/2)²)` where `d` is the hip-to-foot distance, so
 * slack bones do not read as "relaxed" — they read as a zigzag. For a gentle,
 * natural bend of about `0.09` units, size each bone to
 * `sqrt(0.09² + (d/2)²)`, i.e. only a few percent longer than half the span.
 * Bones at `0.6 × d` throw the knee out by a quarter of the leg's length, which
 * is what makes procedural legs look broken even when the gait timing is right.
