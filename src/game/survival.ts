 *
 *   • hold the crowd's fire on a `+N` gate and N climbs, one per half second;
 *   • COMMIT to one leaf of a gate bank — the pillars between them are solid,
 *     and anyone who tries to take two gates at once dies on the divider;
 *   • shoot supply crates: one kind makes every survivor hit harder, the other
 *     makes everyone shoot faster — the ONLY way to raise fire rate in a run;
 *   • anything you failed to destroy kills whoever walks into it.
 *
 * The whole design pressure is one decision repeated: *keep shooting this, or
 * move now — and to WHICH side?* Everything below exists to make that decision
 * legible at a glance on a phone screen, which is why the numbers are small,

 * payouts landed at 92 % of face value by stage 12, 64–74 % by 18, and **53 %**
 * by stage 27 — and it was regressive, because the better the run the sooner it
 * hit the ceiling. The player who read the bank correctly was the one being

 *
 * 1 600 cleared the measured ceiling for a THIRTY-stage career. The campaign is

 *
 * The arithmetic: 9 units of lane, minus two 0.5-wide pillars, leaves 8.0 for
 * three doors — 2.66 WIDE each, so `halfW = 1.33`, the pillars sit at ±1.58 and

 *
 * ⚠ That last number was 2.66 — the door's WIDTH written into the slot that
 * holds its CENTRE. It is worth spelling out what that cost, because both
 * symptoms read as art bugs and neither points at this constant:
 *
 *   • The doors tiled the lane from x = 0 outward instead of filling it, so

 *     leaf ended, with no pillar gap between them and 0.51 units of lane left

 *     posts overlapped: each frame paints a post ~0.75 units in from its own
 *     edge, so the middle door's right post landed at [1.24, 1.58] and the
 *     right door's left post at [1.08, 1.42] — two posts, offset, doubled.
 *   • The divider pillar [1.33, 1.83] then sat INSIDE the outer door rather
 *     than in a gap between doors, which is why it read as a hazard post
 *     standing in a doorway.
 *   • And the real damage: a pillar reaches `DIVIDER_HALF_W + UNIT_R` into its
 *     neighbours, so the outer door's usable strip was [2.13, 3.99] — 1.86
 *     wide, exactly `2 * funnelRadius(1.33)`. A safe aiming band of ZERO width,
 *     with the painted centre 0.4 units outside it. Aiming at the outer door of

 *

 * — 0.50 wide, the same as the two-leaf bank's [2.20, 2.70], with the painted
 * centre inside it.
 *

 *
 * It came down twice. First from 2600, when the base fire rate was more than

 * stages 1–4 (234 / 262 / 194 / 196) while the boss was growing 90 %, so real
 * time-to-kill was 7.9 / 9.6 / 15.6 / 18.6 s against a 5–8 s target and no
 * player short of instant reactions could finish one at all.
 *
 * The growth now lives in `bossHpScale`'s slope instead, where it can be tuned
 * against the stage rather than against the first stage.
 *
 * Then back up from 850 to 1000, because making crates affordable (see
 * `crateHp`) raised the benchmark run's DPS at the boss from 234 to 277–485 and
 * the climax collapsed to 2.4 s. At 1000 a perfect run gets a 3.5–4.5 s finish

 * the end boss died before it threw a single slam. The climax of every stage in
 * the back half of the campaign was a body falling over. A fight the player
 * cannot lose is not a fight, and a fight the player cannot SEE is not even a
 * spectacle.
 *
 * Two rules fix it, and they are deliberately opposite in who they punish:
 *
 *   GUARD — at two-thirds and one-third health the boss plants and becomes
 *           untouchable until it has thrown its next slam. A player with
 *           overwhelming DPS can no longer skip the fight; they get exactly
 *           three swings to dodge instead of zero. It costs an under-built
 *           player nothing, because they were never going to reach the gate
 *           quickly anyway.
 *   RAGE  — every slam it lands makes the next one arrive sooner and reach
 *           further, down to `SLAM_CD_MIN`. A fast kill never sees this. A
 *           twenty-second fight becomes a gauntlet that a squad which arrived
 *           too small genuinely loses.
 *
 * Together they turn "not enough damage" from *slow* into *fatal*, which is the
 * check this genre is missing when the crowd is the only currency.
 */
/**
 * The pillar's cost, split into the two things it was doing at once.
 *
 * `grindAgainst` opens a new contact at `bite` kills and then accrues
 * `max(floor, squad x rate)` per second. Those are different jobs and they were
 * the same number, which is why the first attempt at softening the early pillar
 * did nothing measurable:
 *
 *   BITE  is the LESSON. Touching a pillar costs a survivor, immediately and
 *         visibly, at every stage. That is what makes a bank a commitment, and
 *         it is what fires the "never touch the pillar" hint. It never softens.
 *   FLOOR is the SPIRAL. It is what a crowd pays per second for SITTING on the
 *         pillar, and at 1 it guarantees a body a second no matter how low the
 *         proportional rate goes — which is the whole of what kills a player
 *         who has not yet learned to steer.
 *
 * The distinction matters because of the geometry: a two-leaf bank puts its
 * doors at +/-`GATE_LEAF_X` and its pillar at x = 0, which is exactly where the
 * crowd sits when nobody steers it. THE DEFAULT STATE OF THE GAME IS AIMED AT
 * THE ONE OBJECT THAT KILLS FASTEST. Measured across the opening stages, a run
 * that never steers lost three survivors at EVERY bank and was dead 44 seconds
 * in; a run that steers loses none, because it never touches the thing. The
 * mechanic was all-or-nothing and it landed on the one skill a brand-new player
 * has not acquired.
 *
 * So the bite stays and the spiral ramps. A learner is charged for the mistake
 * once per bank instead of once per second, and by stage 5 the pillar is the
 * full grind again. None of this changes anything for a player who steers.

/**
 * ─── The first five stages are a different game ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything below is one policy with one purpose: a first-time player must not
 * lose a run before they have decided whether they like the game. Playtesting
 * kept producing the same two exits — a hard boss, and dying to scenery — and
 * both happen in the opening minute, which is the minute the whole funnel
 * depends on.
 *
 * It is written as a set of curves in ONE place rather than as edits spread
 * through the authored stages, because the stages are hand-shaped and would
 * fight any change made stage by stage: `stageOne` says what beats the road has,
 * and these say what those beats cost a beginner. A balance pass on the game
 * proper moves the authored numbers; a balance pass on ONBOARDING moves these.
 *
 * Most of them return 1 from stage 6 on, so the game the player eventually
 * arrives at is untouched. The three that do not — the pack, the crate and the
 * elite — hold a last thin slice of relief over stage 6 and let go on 7, for
 * the reason in the next block.
 *
 * ─── …and the way OUT of it is a curve too ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The relief used to be two steps (stages 1-3, then 4-5) that both snapped shut
 * at once. A player reported a hard jump at 3 -> 4 and another at 5 -> 6, and
 * adding up what is standing on each built road says the same thing
 * (`tests/sim/scratch.ramp.test.ts` prints the table):
 *
 *   3 -> 4   total foe health on the road x3.14, and the first boulder and
 *            barricade in the game land on that road.
 *   5 -> 6   foe health x2.48, crate health x2.71, elite health x4.14 — the
 *            second elite starts here — and the first passage.
 *
 * Every neighbouring jump is x1.0-1.6, so those two are where the difficulty
 * actually lives, and not in the authored beats: the roads themselves grow
 * smoothly, and it is the relief coming off in two big handfuls that makes the
 * step. So it comes off in small ones instead, over 4, 5 and (for the three
 * heaviest) 6. That brings the road load — foes plus elites — from x2.18 to
 * x1.85 across 3 -> 4 and from x3.07 to x2.80 across 5 -> 6.
 *
 * What is left in those two numbers is CONTENT rather than tuning: the first
 * scenery that can kill arrives on stage 4, and stage 6 is the first road with
 * a second elite and a passage on it. Softening those means moving a beat, not
 * turning a dial, so they are deliberately left where the design put them.

 * Stages 1 and 2 are the two the relief was too generous on — they play as
 * having no resistance at all, which is a tutorial that teaches nothing about
 * the verb it exists to teach. Both are 15 % tougher than they were (0.6 ->
 * 0.69, 0.7 -> 0.805): enough that a body takes a beat to kill, far short of
 * anything that can end a first session. Their elite and their boss are NOT in
 * this, and on purpose: `bossHpScale` does not move until stage 5, so both are
 * flat across 2-4 and lifting stage 2 alone would leave stage 3's boss weaker
 * than the one before it.
 *
 * Stage 2 therefore carries LESS relief than stage 3, which is not a typo: the
 * stage-3 road has fewer bodies on it than the stage-2 road, so the two land on
 * near-identical total health (69 against 68) and the ramp stays flat across a
 * stage whose new idea is the hound's SPEED rather than its health.
 *
 * Stage 4 then takes a step instead of the whole staircase. The old curve went
 * 0.7 -> 1 there, and stage 4's authored road already more than doubles the
 * bodies on it (4 -> 9), so the two together tripled the health a player met
 * between one stage and the next — the jump that got reported. Stage 5 is left
 * at full price on purpose: it was never the stage anybody complained about,
 * and discounting it would only move the cliff to 5 -> 6.
 *
 * ─── …and stage 1 pays full price, which is not the inversion it looks like ─
 *
 * 0.69 -> 1. Stage 1's discount was buying nothing, and the reason is
 * `earlyPackCap`: stage 1 shows ONE body at a time, so the entire monster
 * budget of the stage is a single creep, and the discount was worth exactly
 * 2 hp on it (6 against 8). Measured through `tests/game/tutorialPump.test.ts`,
 * no policy — not even `careless` — lost a single survivor to a monster on
 * stage 1 either side of the change; the creep dies in a tenth of a second at
 * both prices because the crowd meets it 13-20 strong out of the pumped opening
 * door (`OPENING_PUMP_CAP`).
 *
 * So this is a correctness fix rather than a difficulty one: a stage whose road
 * hands out a `+10` before its first monster has no business ALSO holding a
 * health discount, and leaving one there is a knob that reads as tuned when it
 * is inert. Stage 2 keeps its 0.805, because stage 2 fields two husks at once

 * leaves the boss with no answer to a good player at all: the fight becomes a

 * rather than a stat.
 *
 * It exists because the road had exactly ONE reason to leave the racing line
 * (the crates) and therefore exactly one detour question, asked over and over
 * with the same two answers. A cage asks a different one — *is this crowd worth
 * more to me than the door I am lined up on?* — because a cage is deliberately
 * authored beside a gate bank, on the shoulder AWAY from that bank's best leaf
 * (`placeRescues` in `track.ts`). Taking it costs the approach: the seconds the
 * crowd would have spent pumping the good door, and the lane position it would
 * have spent them from.
 *
 * ── How it is told apart from a crate at speed ──
 *
 * The player has about a quarter of a second, so the two props may not share a
 * silhouette, a colour or a mark, and the difference has to survive being 30 px
 * tall on a phone. Three channels, any one of which is enough:
 *
 *   SHAPE   a crate is a squat rounded box; a cage is a TALL barred cabinet —
 *           the drawn body is half as high again as it is wide and its outline
 *           is broken by four vertical bars, so the silhouette alone reads as
 *           "bars" against the crates' solid block.
 *   COLOUR  the crates own warm green and cold blue with a throbbing rim in the
 *           same hue. A cage is dead grey iron with NO coloured rim at all and
 *           a warm lamp INSIDE it — light coming out of a dark shape, which is
 *           the opposite arrangement to a crate's lit face.
 *   MARK    a crate's badge is a stat glyph (chevron / bolt) and its number is
 *           the HP it costs. A cage carries no stat glyph; it carries a head
 *           count, `+N`, in the crowd's own colour — the same `+` the gates
 *           print, because it pays the same currency they do.
