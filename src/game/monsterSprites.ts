/**
 * ─── Baked monster frames ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The cast in `monsters.ts` is drawn for a design bench: one character per
 * canvas, a hundred-odd path operations each, at whatever cost looks best. The
 * battlefield asks a different question — twenty of them at once, on a phone,
 * next to a tower, particles and projectiles.
 *
 * So each design is rendered ONCE into a short strip of frames covering exactly
 * one locomotion cycle, and the battlefield blits from that strip. Two things
 * follow from "exactly one cycle":
 *
 *   * the loop closes, so a unit can play the strip forever without a pop;
 *   * playback is decoupled from authoring — a strip baked over an 880 ms cycle
 *     can be played at any speed, which is what lets a fast enemy and a slow
 *     one share a body and still move at their own rates.
 *
 * Baking runs in IDLE time, not in the render loop. One frame of the heaviest
 * design costs ~10 ms — over half a frame budget — so any per-frame allowance
 * small enough to be safe would be too small to ever bake it. A wave never
 * arrives during the build phase, so the strips are always ready by the time
 * anything needs them, and a design that has not finished baking simply falls
 * back to the older procedural body instead of stalling the frame.
