 *
 * ── Why nothing new before stage 4 ──
 *
 * The opening three stages are a tutorial (see the relief curves in
 * `survival.ts`) and their whole job is to teach ONE elite and ONE boss well
 * enough that the player knows what a wind-up looks like. Variety before that is
 * not richness, it is noise: a player who has not yet learned that the ring on
 * the ground is dodgeable cannot learn it from three different rings. The pool
 * is the reward for having learned the grammar, not the grammar itself.
 *
 * ── Why the choice is derived, not rolled ──
 *
 * A stage is a pure function of its number everywhere else in this game, and it
 * has to stay one: a player who wipes on stage 7 must be able to LEARN stage 7
 * rather than re-roll it. Cycling by stage also guarantees the player meets each
 * kind before meeting any of them twice.

/**
 * ─── …and the tier the pool grows into ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four elites is enough variety to stop a stage being one fight, and it is not
 * enough to stop a CAREER being four. A player who reaches stage 20 has met
 * every elite the game has four times over, and the complaint that follows is
 * not "this is hard", it is "I have seen this" — the same failure the pool was
 * built to fix, arriving one rotation later.
 *
 * So the pool grows once more, and the two it grows by are deliberately the two
 * questions the first four never ask:
 *
 *   WARDEN    where is the GAP. Every other attack in this game marks ground to
 *             leave; this one marks the whole road except one slot and asks the
 *             player to be IN it. It is the first hazard in the game whose
 *             answer is a place to stand rather than a place to vacate, and that
 *             inversion is worth a whole fight on its own.
 *   BURROWER  which WAY are you going. The bomber commits to where the crowd was
 *             and is answered by one lure and one crossing; this one tracks the
 *             crowd for the whole of its dive and is answered by not stopping —
 *             so the rails become the fight, because a crowd that runs out of
 *             road has to turn around into the thing chasing it.
 *
 * ── Why stage 9, and why the number is derived ──
 *
 * `MINIBOSS_TIER2_FROM_STAGE` has to clear stage 5, and that is a BAKING
 * constraint rather than a pacing preference. A miniboss's body is its fight
 * (`MINIBOSS_DESIGN`), so a new kind means a new strip on the road — and the
 * roster already carries both of these from stage 5 (`bonecap` arrives with the
 * husks on stage 2, `skewer` with the flyers on stage 5). Opening the tier after
 * that costs the loader exactly nothing, where opening it on stage 4 would add
 * two strips to the one stage that has just started fielding variety at all.
 *
 * Nine rather than six is then the pacing half: the first tier's four kinds
 * cycle once across stages 4-7 (see `minibossKindFor`), so a stage-9 road is the
 * first one whose elites the player has genuinely learned — and a new question
 * is a reward for having learned the old ones, not a replacement for them.

/**
 * The full pool, and the ORDER is load-bearing twice over.

 * so a stage fields a WINDOW of it — three consecutive entries for most roads
 * (see `placeMinibosses`), six only past stage 40. What sits where therefore
 * decides both which fights open the tier and which fights share a road.
 *
 *   • THE LATE ARRIVALS GO FIRST, so stage 9 — the road the tier opens on —
 *     fields the warden and the burrower together. A tier whose new fights turn
 *     up four stages after it opened is a tier the player meets by accident.
 *   • THE SCYTHE GOES THIRD, which is the least obvious entry here and the one
 *     a future edit is most likely to undo. Three of the six kinds are
 *     deliberately NOT a solid body for the whole of their fight — a roller
 *     never is, an armed bomber stops being one, and a submerged burrower has no
 *     body on the road at all — and with those three adjacent there are windows
 *     that contain nothing else. A road whose every landmark can be walked
 *     through for part of its fight is a road with no anchor on it: the crowd
 *     never has to route around anything, and the stage reads as a series of
 *     effects rather than as a series of fights. At index 2 the scythe or the

/**
 * ─── The model IS the tell ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One monster design per fight, permanently. A player who has met Snaggletusk
 * once knows the next one cleaves the ground in front of it, and can be moving
 * before the wind-up starts.
 *
 * Without this the two were independent: the design came from whichever
 * archetype the track happened to place (`brute` → Snaggletusk, `hound` →
 * Cinderhound) and the kind came from the stage cycle, so the same body fought
 * four different ways and nothing about a miniboss could be learned in advance.
 * Every OTHER threat in this game is a pure function of the stage for exactly
 * that reason — see the note at the top of this file — and the elites were the
 * one place the rule was not carried through to what the player actually sees.
 *
 * The pairing is also a silhouette argument, not just a lookup:
 *
 *   • SNAGGLETUSK — low, heavy, tusked, front-loaded. It cleaves what is in
 *     front of it. The oldest fight, and the body reads as a charge.
 *   • THORNWICK — tall, rooted, a canopy for a head. It does not close; it
 *     stands off and fires. The one design that cannot plausibly rush you.
 *   • CINDERHOUND — burning, quick, throws itself forward. It plants the bomb
 *     and leaves. Fire is already its whole read.
 *   • RATTLEJACK — the light hound-weight body, for the ball that owns a lane.
 *   • BONECAP — the mushroom IS the shield. A fungal cap slammed down across the
 *     road is the one silhouette in the cast that reads as a wall with a gap in
 *     it before anything has been telegraphed, which is exactly what the warden
 *     needs the player to already suspect.
 *   • SKEWER — the wyrmling, "almost entirely the pointy end". The only body in
 *     the cast that a player would believe goes UNDER the road, and the only one
 *     whose whole shape is the thing that comes back out of it.
 *
 * Kept beside the pool because they are one decision: adding a fifth kind means
 * adding a fifth body here, and a kind with no body of its own would silently
 * reuse another's and undo the lesson.
 *
 * Both late bodies are drawn from designs the ROSTER already carries by the
 * stage their tier opens (`bonecap` with the husks, `skewer` with the flyers) —
 * see `MINIBOSS_TIER2_FROM_STAGE`. That is not a coincidence to be tidied away
 * later: it is why the tier costs the loader nothing, and `minibossIdentity`

// undodgeable ball is a tax with a rolling animation. On a side it leaves a
// clear 4.5 — the whole crowd with room to spare — which is what makes "get out
// of the way" a real instruction rather than an aspiration.
//
// ── Why it may never track ──
//
// Everything else on this road homes on the crowd, which is right for a monster
// and wrong for a rock: a ball that steered would turn the one hazard whose
// entire message is "this line, right here" into another thing that follows you,
// and the player would learn that moving does not work. `stepFoes` REWRITES its

 * A kind is not just a different animation: two of the four carry EFFECTIVE

 * three times, so its bar is worth x1.3 of itself; the summoner spends
 * `SUMMON_WAVES_MAX * SUMMON_PER_WAVE * SUMMON_HP_SHARE` of its own bar on

 * cap charges every player for three heals and only a losing one ever meets the

 *

 * immune, and pays the phase off (see `bossGuardGates`). It is a BARGAIN — the
 * player forfeits damage, the boss owes them a beat — and every kind keeps it,
 * but what the beat IS differs, and that is the whole per-kind decision.
 *
 *   meteor / claw — a swing, unchanged. Overwhelming DPS may not skip the fight,
 *                   and the swing it is made to throw is dodgeable, so the phase
 *                   costs a good player nothing but time.
 *   healer        — a cast, and the gate is load-bearing rather than inherited.
 *                   Measured on the shared cadence the healer's fight is about
 *                   two casts long, so an every-third heal never fires once and
 *                   the whole archetype is dead code; the gates are what buy the
 *                   third cast. That the heal then pushes the bar back ABOVE a
 *                   gate already spent is not a bug: it is the only moment in
 *                   the game where a health bar goes up, and it is the point of
 *                   the creature. `guarded` has already been incremented, so the
 *                   same gate can never re-arm.
 *   summoner      — a WAVE. This is the one that had to be thought about rather
 *                   than inherited. The first pass gave the summoner no gates on
 *                   the grounds that a boss with no attack has nothing to pay a
 *                   phase off with, and measured, that made it a non-fight: at a
 *                   tuned build it died in 0.73 s having spent ZERO waves, so
 *                   the player never met a single skeleton and the archetype
 *                   existed only in the source — the same failure as the
 *                   healer's unreachable heal, from the opposite direction.
 *                   Paying the phase with a wave fixes it without touching the
 *                   rate: the summoner's identity now shows up at least twice

 * ─── Phase two ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * seconds were the same beat at a slightly different tempo.
 *
 * ── Why it hangs off a GUARD GATE and not off a health check ──
 *
 * The obvious shape is `hp / maxHp < 0.5`, and it is wrong here for two
 * measured reasons, both of which the gates already solved:
 *
 *   • A bare threshold is not a beat. A squad of a thousand puts more than a
 *     third of the bar into a single frame (which is the entire reason
 *     `damageBoss` clamps at a gate at all), so "crossed a half" and "crossed a
 *     third" land on the SAME TICK for exactly the players who melt bosses —
 *     two full-screen flashes in one frame, and a phase two the run never
 *     actually plays. Hung off a gate, the turn is a moment the simulation
 *     already guarantees can never be skipped or doubled.
 *   • A threshold un-crosses. There is a healing archetype in the pool, its
 *     whole point is putting the bar back up, and a predicate over live health
 *     therefore flickers. `guarded` only ever counts up, so a latch driven by it
 *     is monotonic by construction rather than by a flag somebody remembered to
 *     write.
 *
 * So `BOSS_ENRAGE_AT` is a BOUND, not a trigger: the fight turns at the first
 * guard gate at or below half health. For the two gates every real stage fields
 * (`BOSS_GUARD_GATES`) that is the one at a third — which is also the one the
 * `bossRage` cue has always described as "the last third is not the same fight
 * as the first". Phase two is that sentence made true; the gate was already
 * there, and it was already the loudest beat in the fight.

 * ─── Faster, but never off the end of the envelope ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The tempting version is "halve `slamCd`". It is a bug at both ends of the
 * ladder and the arithmetic says so out loud.
 *
 * The cadence already falls with every swing thrown (`SLAM_CD_DECAY`) onto a
 * floor (`SLAM_CD_MIN`, 0.95 s) that was NOT picked by feel: below it the
 * cooldown is shorter than the wind-up, so the mark the player is dodging is
 * re-locked before the previous one has landed and the whole warning the player
 * gets is the cadence itself. `SLAM_TELEGRAPH`'s note has the measurement — at
 * 0.62 s of warning a median 250 ms human cleared stage 2 zero times out of
 * however many they were given. Halving the floor puts the fight at 0.48 s,
 * which is on the wrong side of that number for everybody.
 *
 * So phase two does not move the floor. It moves the boss DOWN THE CURVE it was
 * already on: the same rage, arrived at immediately instead of over nine swings,
 * clamped by the same floor. Most fights are over well before swing nine, so
 * this bites exactly where the fight was flat and cannot reach anywhere the
 * design has not already validated.
 *
 * ── …and why the multiplier is divided by the endless pressure ──
 *
 * What one swing COSTS is already a function of the stage:
 * `SLAM_MAX_FRACTION * endlessPressure(stage)`. The crowd-loss rate a boss
 * applies is share ÷ cadence, so tightening the cadence by a flat factor
 * multiplies a number that has ALREADY been multiplied — the same "phase two" is
 * worth 0.43 crowd-shares per span at stage 4 and 0.94 at stage 120, which is
 * the "fine at stage 4, unfair at stage 40" failure written as a product.
 *
 * Dividing the tightening by the pressure the stage already carries holds the
 * ADDED rate roughly constant instead (0.43 → 0.35 across the whole ladder):
 * deep stages already press harder per swing, so they get less extra tempo, and

// player has already lost in every way except the arithmetic.
//
// Reported from a live run: a summoner cut a squad down to ONE survivor, spent
// its last wave, and then stood there. One unit's damage against a boss bar is
// minutes of holding the trigger — and with nothing left on the road there was
// nothing to lose to either. The player ground the fight out for TWELVE
// MINUTES. That is the wave cap working exactly as designed and producing a
// fight with no exit: not a win, not a wipe, just a bar moving too slowly to
// watch. The cap is right; what was missing is that a decided fight has to be
// allowed to END.
//
// So when the wall is spent AND the crowd is down to a handful, the summoner
// starts calling single bodies up at its own FLANKS. Two things about that
// placement are the whole point:
//
//   • they come up BESIDE THE BOSS, not ahead of the crowd like a wave, so they
//     walk the length of the arena and a squad with anything left in it simply
//     shoots them — this can never take a fight the player is still winning;

//     the run resolves. The player gets a death and a restart instead of a
//     grind.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a rate on the boss's own budget: these bodies are
// unpriced (`bossHpMulFor` knows nothing about them) because they only exist in
// fights whose outcome is already settled, where pricing is meaningless.

// `SUMMON_AHEAD`), and a module-level `const` that reads a `const` declared
// later in the same file is a ReferenceError at import time rather than a lint
// warning.
//
// Deriving rather than re-typing is the whole point of those references — see

// drawn instead of computed — so the file order follows the arithmetic.

//
// It plants in front of the crowd and slams a row of stone slabs down across
// the ENTIRE road, leaving one slot open. Everything in the slabs pays; the slot
// costs nothing at all.
//
// ── The one attack in this game whose answer is a place to BE ──
//
// Every other hazard here marks ground to leave. The ring says "not this spot",
// the rake says "not these three strips", the ball says "not this half", the
// bomb says "not next to me" — and after four elites and four bosses a player
// has learned one verb, which is *away*. The warden inverts it: the road is
// lethal except one slot, so the input is not a flinch away from a mark, it is
// aiming for one. It is also the cheapest new question the game can ask, because
// the player already owns the whole vocabulary — a strip on the ground and a
// countdown — and only the sign is different.
//
// ── Why it is slabs and not a wall with a hole ──
//
// The hole has to be READ, and read from the corner of an eye on a phone. A
// solid bar with a notch in it is a bar; a row of separate teeth with one
// missing is a gap, and the eye finds a missing tooth without being told to look
// for one. It is also honest about the simulation: the kill test is the slabs
// themselves (`inClawFurrow`, which is exactly what a row of strips is), so what
// is drawn is what bills.

//
// ── WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING ──
//
// The bomber already asks a question about position, and the answer to it is one
// lure and one crossing: it commits to where the crowd WAS and then cannot
// change its mind, so the whole fight is decided in a single input. This one
// never commits until the end, and what it follows is not the crowd — it is the
// crowd HALF A SECOND AGO (`BURROWER_LAG`).
//
// That one decision is the entire fight, and everything good about it falls out
// of the same sentence:
//
//   • a crowd that keeps moving is always ahead of its own past, so sustained
//     motion in any direction is a clean escape and the player is rewarded for
//     the thing this genre is about;
//   • a crowd that STOPS is caught, because a stationary crowd's past is exactly
//     where it is standing;
//   • a crowd that REVERSES is caught worst of all, because it is running back
//     down its own trail into the thing chasing it — and "do not turn around" is
//     a lesson no other hazard in this game teaches.
//
// A pursuit at a fixed speed was the obvious first shape and it is a worse fight
// on arithmetic alone. The road is 8.2 units of reachable width and a pursuer
// converges on any crowd that is not at a full sprint, so the only survivable
// answer is a maximal rail-to-rail run, every time, from wherever the player
// happens to be: one input, executed perfectly, or eat it. A trail has no such
// cliff — every unit of movement buys exactly its own unit of separation, so the
// dodge is graded and the player is allowed to be partly right.

/**
 * How far behind the crowd the mound runs, in SECONDS — and LATERALLY only.

 * mound is at a lateral position the player was actually standing at, so the
 * separation they have bought is the distance they have covered — a quantity
 * they can watch themselves producing rather than one they have to infer from a
 * chase.
 *
 * Half a second is read off the crowd's own controls. `STEER_SPRING` settles a
 * full-lane move in about a third of a second, so half a second is comfortably
 * more than one deliberate input: a player who makes ONE decision has already
 * bought their separation before the mound has finished arriving at the place
 * they made it.
 *
 * ── Why the mound does NOT lag along the road ──
 *
 * It did, for one revision, and the fight did not exist. The road carries the
 * crowd forward at `stageSpeed` whatever the player does, so half a second of
 * lag along it is nearly three units of free separation that nobody chose — and
 * measured, a crowd standing perfectly still took **zero** casualties from an
 * eruption. The whole attack was answered by the road.
 *
 * There is also no decision in that axis to reward. The player steers left and
 * right; forward is the game's own clock. So the mound follows the crowd's line
 * along the road exactly (`stepBurrower` reads `anchorY` live) and lags only in
 * the axis the player controls, which is the axis the question is asked in.

// ─── The second verb ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four boss kinds is four fights, and four fights is not four HUNDRED fights.
// The pool fixed "every stage ends the same way"; what it could not fix is that
// each kind still shows the player everything it has inside its first four
// seconds, and from the second time they meet it there is nothing left to learn.
// The lane charge (`bossCharges`) was the first answer to that and it is only
// half of one: it goes to two of the four kinds, and only in phase two, and only
// once the fight has already turned.
//
// So every kind gets a SECOND ATTACK, and the four of them are chosen the same
// way the kinds themselves were — one question each, and never a question
// another attack in the game already asks:
//
//   meteor    SHOCK      a ring of fire with a hole in the middle of it. The one
//                        attack in the game whose answer is to run INTO the
//                        mark, which is the exact inverse of the verb the player
//                        has spent the whole game learning.
//   claw      CROSSRAKE  the rake, and then a second rake through its own
//                        pockets. The pocket you chose becomes the furrow, so
//                        the answer is not a position, it is a ROUTE.
//   healer    WARD       the heal, contested. It plants the circle a full cycle
//                        early and the heal is denied by however much of the
//                        crowd is standing on it — the only fight in the game
//                        that was pure arithmetic gets an input.
//   summoner  FLANKS     the wave comes up at both rails instead of in front, so
//                        the two packs converge and standing in the middle means
//                        meeting both at once. The safe-feeling centre line is
//                        the wrong answer.
//
// ── The one rule all four obey: a variant REPLACES a cycle ──
//
// None of them is an extra attack, and that is not a coincidence — it is the
// only shape that does not silently re-price a fight somebody already balanced.
// Every kind's damage is `share ÷ cadence`, and both terms are load-bearing:
// `BOLT_SHARE_MUL` is 0.6 *because* the healer's loop is 1.7 s, `SUMMON_BUDGET`
// prices the summoner's own health bar, and `enragedSpan`'s note records what
// happened the two times a cycle was tightened without re-deriving its cost.
//
// So a variant lands on a cycle the fight was going to spend anyway, and it is
// priced at exactly what the cycle it replaced was worth:
//
//   • the shock and the crossrake each spend ONE `bossHitShare` budget, the same
//     single-swing price the lane charge is documented at — a crossrake's two
//     passes share one budget rather than billing one each;
//   • the ward spends a HEAL, whose price is already in the printed health bar
//     (`bossHpMulFor`), and costs the crowd nothing at all;
//   • the flanks wave spends a WAVE out of `SUMMON_BUDGET`, with the same body
//     count, the same health share and the same walk-in distance. Only the x
//     changes.
//
// A fight therefore has more to show and exactly as much to cost, which is the
// whole difference between "more content" and "harder".

/**
 * The stage the second verbs open on, and it is DERIVED rather than picked.
 *
 * `bossKindFor` strides the pool so that stages 4-7 field claw, meteor, summoner
 * and healer — every kind exactly once. Stage 8 is therefore the first fight in
 * the game the player has met before, and a repeat is precisely where a new move
 * belongs: it arrives as "this one does something else too" rather than as one
 * more unfamiliar thing on a road already full of them.
 *
 * Reading it off the two constants that make that true keeps it true. A fifth
 * boss kind pushes the whole rotation out by a stage, and a variant tier that
 * opened before the rotation finished would show a player a kind's second attack
 * before its first.

// with one verb between them, and a player who has learned that verb has, in a
// real sense, learned the whole game: when something lights up, go.
//
// The gaze is the one attack whose answer is to STOP. The boss plants, an eye
// opens over it, and for as long as the eye is open any movement of the crowd is
// punished — a beam straight down the column the crowd is standing in. A crowd
// that holds still costs nothing at all, and keeps shooting a boss that is not
// throwing anything else.
//
// ── Why it is a real question and not a free window ──
//
// Because it is the only one that fights the player's own reflex. Every other
// telegraph in this game has trained the thumb to flinch the moment something
// lights up, and the gaze lights up exactly like everything else. The skill is
// the SETTLE: the eye opens while the player may still be finishing a dodge from
// the attack before, and the whole of `GAZE_OPEN` is the time they get to let the
// crowd come to rest. A player who is still dragging when the eye finishes
// opening pays for it.
//
// It also turns the other attacks into better questions. A healer bolt already
// in the air when the eye opens is a genuine dilemma — eat the bolt, or break
// the gaze to step out of it — and a summoner's pack walking in while the eye is
// open is the one moment in that fight where standing still is expensive too.
// None of that is scripted; it falls out of the gaze pausing the boss's own
// clock rather than replacing it (see `stepBoss`).
//
// ── Why one shared verb and not one per kind ──
//

 * watching: the boss plants, roars and goes untouchable. The eye opening there
 * is the lesson arriving where the attention already is.
 *
 * ── Why a stage-2 fallback at all ──
 *
 * A stage-1 run can end before the gate — a wiped crowd, a quit — and a teaching
 * beat that a bad first run can skip is a teaching beat half the players never
 * get. Stage 2 is the last chance rather than a second showing: the flag is set

// ─── No fixed rotation: the attack bag ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A fight used to be a schedule. `CHARGED_EVERY`, `CHARGE_EVERY` and a third
// every-third for the variant partitioned the swings by residue, so a stage-9
// meteor threw
// its attacks in the same order on every attempt and a player who had fought it
// twice could recite it. That was a deliberate choice — the rest of this file is
// built on "a stage is a pure function of its number, so it can be LEARNED" —
// and for a boss with three verbs it turned out to be the wrong one: what the
// player learned was the order, not the attacks.
//
// So each fight draws its attacks from a SHUFFLE BAG. Every attack the boss has
// is in the bag once; the bag is shuffled, drawn from until empty, and refilled.
// Two properties fall out of that and they are the whole requirement:
//
//   EQUAL   across a fight, every attack is thrown equally often — never more
//           than one apart, at any point in the fight. A random pick per swing
//           would not promise that: a coin can come up heads five times, and a
//           meteor that threw five rings in a row would be the old metronome
//           with worse manners.
//   FRESH   the order is shuffled per ATTEMPT (`bossPatternSeed`), so a retry
//           is not a replay.
//
// ── What is still learnable, and what is not ──
//
// The SET of attacks is still a pure function of the stage — which kind, which
// verbs, from which stage — and every attack still carries its full telegraph.
// What the player can no longer learn is the ORDER, which is the thing that had
// stopped being a fight. The balance rule survives too: an attack costs what it
// costs whichever slot of the bag it lands in, so a fight's total price is set
// by how many of each it throws, and the bag holds that count constant.

 *     keeps its own schedule; the bag decides what the OTHER casts are. The ward
 *     rides on the heal, so it stays out with it.
 *   • the CHARGED RING. It is the meteor's ring at double size, not a different
 *     attack, and it keeps its own every-`CHARGED_EVERY` count — over RINGS
 *     rather than over swings, so the bag does not dilute it into rarity.
