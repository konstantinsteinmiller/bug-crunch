/**
 * ─── The track generator ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A stage is a fixed, seeded score — not a random stream. Same stage number,
 * same layout, every device, every session. That matters more than it sounds:
 *
 *   • a player who wipes on stage 6 can LEARN stage 6 rather than re-roll it;
 *   • the resumable run snapshot only has to store a stage number and a
 *     distance, because the layout is reproducible from those two;
 *   • balance is testable — `tests` can walk a stage and assert its shape.
 *
 * The rhythm is deliberate and repeats every ~25 units:
 *
 *      hazard → (supplies / coins) → GATE BANK → hazard …
 *
 * The bank is always the beat you are running toward, and there is always
 * something in the way of standing still on it.
 *
 * What a bank is
 * ──────────────
 * A bank is TWO leaves with a SOLID PILLAR between them, so running the centre
 * line is fatal. The player must commit to a side — which means the two leaves
 * may never be worth the same thing, or the commitment is a coin flip dressed
 * up as a decision. Every two-leaf bank this file emits asks one of exactly two
 * questions:
 *
 *   • `add | add`, `add | mul` → "how long do I stand here, and on which side?"
 *     (only `add` leaves climb under sustained fire, so the pumpable leaf is
 *     worth more the longer you are willing to be shot at);
 *   • `mul | div`, `mul | mul` → "pick one, right now" — a pure routing call
 *     with nothing to pump and no way to improve the offer by waiting.
 *
 * Stages alternate between the two so a run never settles into one verb.
 *
 * …and from `TRIPLE_STAGE`, the spike
 * ──────────────────────────────────
 * THREE leaves and two pillars (`GATE3_*` in `survival.ts`): a narrow centre
 * door flanked by two narrow side doors. A two-leaf bank is a side to commit to;
 * a three-leaf bank is an ORDERING — the player has to rank three offers against
 * the crowd they happen to be carrying, in the second and a half before they
 * arrive, and the crowd has to funnel to fit whichever door they picked.
 *
 * They are deliberately rare (see `maxTriples`). The centre door is the one a
 * player who does nothing rolls into — it is the only door in the game with no
 * pillar in front of it — so it carries the MODEST offer most of the time and
 * the trap often enough that drifting into it is never free.
 *
 * Everything with a number in it lives in the ── Difficulty knobs ── block
 * below, so a simulation pass can retune the whole game from one screenful.

/**
 * Stage 1's single elite: four times what a normal first miniboss carries.
 *
 * It is the only enemy on the stage that cannot be walked past, and it stands
 * in for the boss that stage 1 no longer has. The job is to teach "a big one
 * needs a bigger crowd" in a fight the player cannot lose — so it is priced to
 * be BEATEN, not to be a wall. Expressed as a multiple of `MINIBOSS_FIRST`
 * rather than as a raw number, so a balance pass on the elites still moves the
 * tutorial with them.
 *
 * ─── It was 0.4, and that number was measured out of date ───────────────────
 *
 * At `0.4 x MINIBOSS_FIRST` the body carried 26 hp, and it was reported — from
 * a real first session — as dying "in 0.25 seconds or so". The simulation says
 * exactly that. Driven through `tests/game/tutorialPump.test.ts` (the real
 * `steerOnly` hold, released by the shipping `tickTutorial` clock, seeds
 * 1000/8919/16838):
 *
 *   policy      squad at the elite    dps    time to kill
 *   average             26            112       0.18 s
 *   good                26            112       0.23 s
 *   optimal             47            430       0.53 s
 *   careless            24            104       0.55 s
 *
 * — and every one of those runs finished the whole road having lost NOTHING to
 * a monster or a box. The last beat before the arena was three frames long.
 *
 * Two things had moved out from under the constant.
 *
 *   1. THE OPENING DOOR. Stage 1 opens on a solo `+3` that pumps to
 *      `OPENING_PUMP_CAP` = 10, and the crowd reaches it holding the full ten
 *      (nine without the tutorial hold — the door caps either way, see below).
 *      The road's beats were priced for the squad of ~6 that a `+3` produced;
 *      what actually walks down it is 13 at the teaching wall and 24-47 at the
 *      elite.
 *   2. THE BOSS STOPPED BEING A FIXED BAR. `minibossHp` prices this against
 *      `BOSS_BASE_HP * bossHpScale(1)` — a flat 1000 — but stage 1's boss has
 *      been sized to the crowd that arrives since `game/adaptive.ts`, and it
 *      measures 848-2277 in the runs above. So a fraction meant to read as
 *      "about a quarter of the boss" (see `MINIBOSS_FIRST`) was landing at
 *      1-3 % of the climax it is supposed to be warming up for.
 *
 * Four puts 258 hp on the body, which is 12-22 % of the bar the same run's boss
 * actually turns out to carry (1151-2180) — back either side of the quarter the
 * elites were designed around — and measures, same harness, same seeds:
 *
 *   policy      time to kill    survivors it costs
 *   average        1.55 s              0
 *   good           2.55 s             10
 *   optimal        2.65 s             10
 *   careless       2.63 s              1
 *
 * …and 1.58-5.30 s for the same four players on a run that never saw the
 * lightbox, which is the shape that was wanted: the hold hands the player a
 * head start, and the beat it walks into is now priced for the head start
 * instead of for the squad of six a bare `+3` used to produce.
 *
 * A beat rather than a formality, and the first thing on stage 1 that charges
 * a player who stands in front of it. It is deliberately still not a wall: the
 * elite's leash is `ELITE_HOLD_MAX` = 3 s, so even the run that cannot kill it
 * walks away rather than being stopped, and every policy above still clears the
 * stage on every seed.

 * Base `+N` printed on a fresh `add` leaf, before any pumping.

 * One per stage up to 14, then a little over half that. The knee is the whole

 * 340 units and fits thirteen banks against stage 6's five). Left linear, the
 * additive path alone hands a stage-30 run four hundred survivors before a
 * single multiplier is counted, and every `×N` after that is a promise the
 * `MAX_SQUAD` ceiling quietly breaks.
 *
 * ─── The flat term, and why it has moved twice ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was 2. It went to 4 when the guns stopped outranging the camera: a bank
 * used to be shootable from ~26 units out, which at stage speed is a ~4.8 s
 * pump (nine ticks), and in range the same approach is ~2.0 s (four). That took
 * `average` from a 60–100 % clear rate to 0 % on stages 2, 3 and 5, so the
 * value the pump could no longer add moved into the print.
 *
 * It is now **3**, and the shortfall against the requested −3 is measured
 * rather than chosen. Doors pay less so the exponential they drive starts
 * smaller, which is the ask; how much less is bounded by the career:
 *
 *   −1 (this)  campaign clean — a competent player reaches stage 12 inside the
 *              retry budget, `optimal` still clears the authored stages.
 *   −2         campaign completes, but one stage in twelve costs a competent
 *              player a FOURTH attempt.
 *   −3         a competent player walls at stage 6 and never recovers: at
 *              stage 1 a door prints `+1` against a starting squad of 3, so the
 *              crowd never gets started and every later multiplier has nothing
 *              to multiply.
 *
 * The flat cut is also the wrong shape for the goal it was aimed at. "Harder to
 * amass tons of units" is about the top of the curve, and −3 costs stage 1
 * seventy-five per cent of a door while costing stage 14 twenty-three. The rule
 * that actually attacks the compounding is `canMul`'s new spacing clause: two
 * `×2` banks in a row was a free quadruple for anybody who could aim twice, and
 * that is now impossible.
 *
 * ─── …and the slope past stage 14 is a tenth shallower ─────────────────────
 *
 * Both slopes after the knee — the +0.55 a stage and the logarithm below — are

// learned the arithmetic is only executing it. A door with no number on it
// cannot be executed, so the bank becomes a gamble the player chooses to take

//      leaves are face-up. A bank of two unknowns is a coin flip with no
//      decision in it, which is the opposite of the point.
//   2. NEVER ON A DILEMMA. When both doors already take something, the player
//      is choosing which loss to eat; hiding one of them turns a hard choice
//      into an unfair one.
//   3. IT CANNOT BE PUMPED. Fire raises a door's number, and a number nobody
//      can see cannot be raised in front of them — the crowd would be spending
//      fire on a promise. See `stepGates`.
//   4. NOT BEFORE THE ARITHMETIC IS LEARNED. It starts at `MYSTERY_STAGE`,
//      well after `÷` and `×` have both been met, because a face-down door is
//      only interesting to someone who knows what a face-up one is worth.

 *

 * to know which side of it their own squad is on — with one bank's worth of
 * road to work it out. That is the whole feature: a pair whose gamble lane is
 * always better is not a decision, it is a reading test.
 *
 * At stage 22 (`gateAddBase` 19) it prints `−10 then ×2` against
 * `+21 then +16` — equal at 57 survivors, so a squad of 45 should take the adds
 * and a squad of 90 should take the bill. The printed multiplier opens at
 * `gateMulOpen(2)` = 1.6 and pumps toward 2 under fire, so the real crossing is
 * a BAND from ~90 down to 57 rather than a point, which is if anything better:
 * shooting the door is what moves it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THE FIRST ADD IS THE BIG ONE, and why it is floored at `base + 2`.
 *
 * `legalise` rule 5 — "a hostile door needs something worth crossing the lane
 * for beside it" — sees ONE bank at a time. The pair's first bank is `−S`
 * beside an add, so if that add scores under `gateAddBase` the rule grows it to
 * `base + 2` and the authored crossover quietly moves: asking for `+8` at
 * stage 22 produced `+22` on the road and shifted the crossing from 60 to 74.
 *
 * The rule is right about ordinary banks and wrong about this one — here the
 * thing worth crossing for is on the NEXT bank, and a lane is the offer rather
 * than a door. But it is a safety rule, and the cost of exempting the pair from
 * it is a `−S` with nothing beside it on any road where the second bank fails
 * to materialise. So the shape obeys the rule instead of dodging it: the steady
 * lane's larger add goes on the FIRST bank, where it has to clear the floor,
 * and the smaller one on the second, where no hostile door means rule 5 never
 * looks. The player is committed by then anyway — past the rib, the second

 * Make a list of offers legal, whatever the caller asked for.

 * Every rule that makes a bank a DECISION is enforced here rather than at the
 * call sites, so neither a hand-authored stage nor an unlucky roll can print
 * one that is not. All of them generalise to any leaf count:
 *
 *   1. at most one `div` in a bank. A trap is only a trap when something beside
 *      it is visibly better; two of them is a toll booth with extra steps.
 *   2. `÷5` never lands in two consecutive banks — that is not difficulty, it
 *      is a dead run.
 *   3. the stage's multiplier budget (`mulLeaves` / `mulThrees`) is spent here,
 *      so it cannot be dodged by a caller that builds its leaves in an unusual
 *      order. A leaf the budget cannot pay for degrades rather than vanishing —
 *      `×3` to `×2` when the stage's one `×3` is gone, `×N` to `+N` when the
 *      leaves are.
 *   4. no two leaves are identical in BOTH op and value. Identical leaves turn
 *      the pillars into a pure punishment for existing: you commit to a door,
 *      gain nothing for having chosen well, and die if you dither.
 *   5. a trap is always paired with something clearly good — at least one leaf
 *      worth a full `gateAddBase` — or the bank is a tax rather than an offer.
 *      EXCEPT when the bank is a deliberate dilemma; see 6.
 *   6. a DILEMMA — every door hostile, `÷N` against `-N` — is legal, rationed,
 *      and never accidental. It is the one bank with no right answer, only a
 *      cheaper wrong one, and which is cheaper depends on the crowd the player
 *      brought. One per stage, from stage 4, never two banks running, and never
 *      as the last bank before the boss (a run should die to the climax, not to
 *      a toll booth three seconds before it).

  //      of nearly every stage. A player learns within three stages that the
  //      game is not asking them anything, which is the shape of boredom.
  //
  //      Against a different op the answer moves with the crowd. `+9` beside
  //      `x2` flips at nine survivors; `-N` beside `/2` flips at twice the bill.
  //      The player has to look at their own squad to answer, and the answer is
  //      different on a good run than on a bad one.
  //
  //      The partner ALTERNATES rather than always being a multiplier: `x2` on
  //      every bank would inflate the economy and become its own kind of
  //      wallpaper. A trap is preferred when the pacing rules above have left
  //      room for one (they cap traps per bank and cool big ones down), and the
  //      multiplier is taken otherwise, subject to the same `mulLeft` budget
  //      rule 3 spends. If neither is affordable the bank stays as it was —
  //      running out of budget must never cost a door.
  //      SCOPED TO THE STAGES WHERE THE PLAYER IS DECIDING WHETHER TO STAY.
  //      Below stage 6 the multiplier budget is unlimited (`mulLeaves`), so the
  //      repair is free and the economy absorbs it. From stage 6 the budget is
  //      three, and every way of paying for it was measurably worse: charging
  //      `mulLeft` starved the authored `xN` near the arena and nothing killed
  //      the stage-12 boss; not charging it inflated the crowd into the
  //      autobalancer, which raised enemy health to match and stalled a good
  //      player at stage 11; and using a trap instead turned two paying doors
  //      into a toll and made the road poorer everywhere it fired.
  //
  //      All three are re-tunings of a late-game curve that was balanced against
  //      free `add|add` banks, and that is a bigger job than this rule. The
  //      diagnosis was about stages 1-3 — the opening bank of nearly every early

/**
 * ─── Passages: the bank you cannot change your mind about ───────────────────
 *
 * A rib of unbreakable stone running back down the road from a bank's pillar,
 * splitting the approach into two corridors — one per door.
 *
 * Every bank is already a commitment, but only at the last moment: the crowd
 * can sit on the centre line reading both offers and slide to whichever door it
 * likes with half a second to spare, which makes a bank a REACTION rather than
 * a decision. A passage moves the commitment upstream. Both doors are in plain
 * sight the whole way in — that is the point, and it is why the rib is short
 * enough to fit on screen with the bank — but the moment the crowd enters a
 * corridor the other offer is behind a wall it cannot shoot through.
 *
 * ─── The three numbers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * LENGTH is a decision window, so it is expressed in seconds and converted at
 * the stage's own speed: `PASSAGE_SECONDS` = 1.2, which at stage 6's 5.6 u/s is
 * about seven units of road. Long enough that the choice is made before the
 * bank rather than at it, short enough that the corridor mouth and the doors
 * are on screen together — a wall that arrives before the offer it splits is
 * not a decision, it is a guess.
 *
 * WIDTH is the pillar's own contact width and not a unit more. The pillar
 * already reaches `DIVIDER_HALF_W + UNIT_R` = 0.55 into the lane, so a rib of
 * the same width adds no new constraint to a crowd that was going to take a
 * door cleanly: the safe aiming band is the same [2.20, 2.55] it always was.
 * Wider stone would quietly turn every passage bank into a precision test.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS is a cut, not a kill. A crowd that enters the mouth straddling
 * the rib is divided on it — the corridor holding more survivors keeps them all,
 * the other loses all of its — and the rib is inert afterwards. It is one
 * decision for the whole rib rather than a dozen separate lethal boulders, and
 * `stepRocks` carries the measurement of why: billed stone by stone, a rib took
 * a 203-strong crowd to zero in a quarter of a second.
 *
 * CADENCE is every third or fourth bank, rolled per passage so the player
 * cannot count bars. Never the first bank of a stage — the opening bank is
 * where a run's crowd is smallest and the shape is still being read — and never
 * a three-leaf bank, whose two pillars would leave a centre corridor 1.2 units
 * wide against a crowd 3.3 across.

  //
  // A single box at x=0 taught that lesson badly, in two different ways at once:

  // thing a box ever did to you was cost you people. Neither outcome contains
  // the reward, and both are one thumb-width away from the version that does.
  //
  // So the first one is not a box, it is a WALL of boxes — the full width of the
  // road, with no way past it. Wherever the player happens to be standing they
  // are already shooting one, and the squad auto-fires, so the reward arrives
  // whether or not they understood that it was on offer. That is the point: this
  // beat is not asking a question, it is delivering an answer.
  //
  // Pinned to 1 HP, deliberately. A rolled stage-1 rate crate is 9 HP, which a
  // starting squad of three cannot clear before it arrives — so the box that was
  // meant to teach "shoot it" would instead demonstrate "it costs you people".

  // without ever being SHOWN it. The genre's whole fantasy is the crowd
  // exploding, and stage 1 never did it once.
  //
  // So the last door before the elite is a multiplier, and BOTH leaves are good:
  // x2 against a fat add. There is deliberately no wrong answer — stage 3 owns
  // the lesson that a multiplier can be a trap, and this is not a lesson, it is
  // the trailer. The crowd roughly doubles, smashes the elite with it, and
  // carries it into the arena, which is the shot the whole stage builds to.
  //
  // It REPLACES the bank that used to sit here rather than being added after it:
  // a fourth gate this late pushed the elite off the end of the road (the

  // width. The earned version arrives on stage 4 and every other stage after
  // (`stageHasWeapon`); this is the one that teaches what the thing IS, so that
  // the levers on stage 4 read as a lock on something known rather than as two
  // posts with no explanation.
  //
  // ⚠ IT SITS AFTER THE ELITE, and that is not a layout preference.
  //
  // The gift was at y = 77 first — mid-road, in the widest clear stretch the
  // stage has — and it broke a rule the campaign is built on: a run that never
  // touches the screen must not clear the taught stages RELIABLY (see
  // `balance.test.ts`, "walks the taught stages and is stopped by the game"). A
  // box this wide on the centre line is, by construction, exactly where a crowd
  // that never steers already is, so a no-input run collected a free gatling
  // — and stage 2's careless clear rate went from about a quarter to 3 of 3.
  //
  // The miniboss at ~91 is what stops those runs, so the fix is to hand the
  // prize over AFTER it: the elite still has to be met on the squad's own gun,
  // and the weapon is what the player carries into the closing bank and the
  // boss. Measured, that puts the clear rate back under the line.
  //
  // y = 113 is the middle of the 104 → 122 gap, the widest clear stretch left
  // once the elite has had its road: 7.2 units either side, nothing to nudge.
  //
  // Nothing here is lethal, which is the whole reason it can exist this early:
  // the box grinds a trickle off a crowd that ploughs into it (`grindAgainst`,
  // priced as a crate) and hands the weapon over when it breaks.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT IS AN OPEN BOX, which is a rule about this beat and not about the
  // mechanic. `gift: true` no longer only means "no toll to stand on it": it
  // means the box spawns UNLOCKED, wears its lid thrown back and the gun lifted
  // out of it, and is shootable from the moment it is on screen. The full
  // argument — including why the stage-4 puzzle box deliberately stays shut —
  // is on `WeaponBox.locked`, but the part that belongs to the LAYOUT is this:
  // the position above buys the beat its fairness (after the elite, in the one
  // clear stretch left), and the position is worthless if the player cannot
  // tell what the object is until they are on top of it. A closed box at y=113

 * papering over it. Fractions of `arenaY` place a beat at the same point in the
 * STAGE regardless of how long the stage is, which is what "a third of the way

// out of a bank's reading band, a crate row off another crate row, a prize off
// the centre line — and between them they left the simplest question about a
// road unasked: is anything drawn standing inside anything else.
//
// Swept as axis-aligned bodies across the finished layouts of stages 1-300, the
// answer was 28 pairs: a supply crate inside the weapon prize (stages 36, 90,
// 100), inside a lever, its cover stone or the armour over the box (6, 18, 20,
// 22, 26, 100, 150), and inside a boulder or a wall block (33, 35, 37, 50, 100,
// 161, 175, 200). None of them is a balance question. Each one is a box with
// another prop's sprite growing out of it, and a crate buried in a boulder
// cannot be shot at all — the round stops on the rock in front of it.
//
// ── The crate is the thing that moves ──
//
// Everything a crate can clash with is placed RELATIVE to something the player
// has to read: a lever to its cover stone, the box to its levers, a pillar to
// its doors, a rescue to the bank it hangs off. A supply crate is the one prop
// on the road whose exact position carries no second promise — it is a reward
// you detour for, and it is still that reward a third of a unit away.
//
// ── Along the road first, and only then across it ──
//
// `y` is the axis every other rule in this file is written in, so a shift along
// the road is re-checked against the gate bands and the ends of the road; `x`
// is free of all of them, but it is the axis the player reads the DETOUR on.
// So the smallest legal move wins and the row is tried first: a shove of 0.3
// down the road beats a lateral 2.0 that walks a shoulder crate into the middle
// of the lane.

/**
 * ─── Where on the road the beat goes ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be one number — just under halfway, every stage, forever — and
 * that is the version a player described as boring in exactly those terms: once
 * you know the puzzle is at the midpoint you stop looking for it, you steer to
 * the rail when the progress bar says so, and the beat whose entire content is
 * "did you notice" has been reduced to a timer.
 *
 * So it rotates through four slots instead, and the rotation is a pure function
 * of the stage number like everything else on this road: a player who wipes on
 * stage 12 meets the same puzzle in the same place on the retry, and a player
 * who has run stage 12 before can PLAN for it. Varied is not the same as random.
 *
 * The four are chosen to ask different questions rather than to spread numbers
 * evenly:
 *
 *   MID   — the original. The weapon is worth carrying for most of what is left,
 *           and the crowd solving it has been through two or three banks.
 *   EARLY — a small crowd, a cheap sweep, and a weapon for almost the whole
 *           road. The prize is biggest here and the squad that has to win it is
 *           weakest, which is the trade.
 *   LATE  — most of the stage is already spent, so it is a decision about the
 *           run-in rather than about the run: turn for it, or bank what you have.
 *   CLOSE — the last thing on the road. A launcher handed over here is a
 *           launcher for the boss and nothing else, which is not a downgrade —
 *           it is a different purchase, and it lands on the fight where five
 *           rockets into one health bar is the best the weapon ever gets.
 *
 * `clear` is how much road behind the arena that slot's box must finish in. The
 * first three keep the whole of the closing bank's run-in to themselves; CLOSE
 * deliberately does not, and `WEAPON_CLOSING_CLEAR` is the argument for why
 * that is safe.

 *
 * It may not go much below this either, and the floor is a hard mechanical one

 * short of the arena is passed at the exact moment the run-in ends and can then
 * never be shot again — rounds only travel up the road — so the prize would

 * for a foe's bite or a pillar's graze — because it is a yardstick rather than a

 * the stage opened — which is why the shop's two crowd tracks are arguments
 * rather than reads. A player who bought Squad to level ten should not be told
 * they played badly for arriving with the crowd their purchase guaranteed.

 * outranging the camera. Four is therefore what a player who commits the moment
 * a bank enters range actually banks — the `optimal` policy's whole edge over
 * `good`, which commits late and pumps nothing.
