/**
 * ─── Art sheet manifest ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Survivalist draws everything procedurally, which is wonderful for payload and
 * useless for one specific job: handing the art to somebody — or something —
 * that paints. There is no folder of PNGs to send. This module describes the
 * REFERENCE SHEETS that bake the whole cast out of the renderer, so the art can
 * leave, be repainted in a dark-fantasy hand, and come back in as drop-ins.
 *
 * Two shapes of sheet:
 *
 *   WALKS   a grid of panels showing one creature through one locomotion
 *           cycle. Each panel is the bake's own frame box scaled up, so a
 *           painted strip drops straight back in with the feet on the same
 *           line and nothing downstream has to be told where they are.
 *   STILLS  one object per image. A still is a one-frame walk to the slicer,
 *           which is what gives every prop, round and effect the same fit
 *           step the creatures get: the return is measured against the
 *           reference and normalised onto it, so a crate painted with a
 *           polite margin still fills its box in play.
 *
 * THE BOX IS THE CONTRACT. Every still is drawn by the renderer's OWN painter
 * (`useSurvivalArt`) into exactly the rectangle the renderer blits the
 * painting back into. Get the bench and the runtime out of step and every
 * painted part is the wrong size, everywhere, invisibly — so the bench never
 * carries a size of its own; it reads the same constants the painters do.
 *
 * Nothing here imports a canvas. The manifest says WHAT goes on each sheet and
 * WHERE the result belongs; `ArtSheets.vue` knows how to paint it.

// after the unit got killed it immediately transitions to dead state"), and the
// second is the IMPACT, which is what the eye needs to read a landing and is the
// answer to the other half of the ask: a survivor that runs into a barricade
// crumples against it.
//

// (`heroSprites.drawSurvivorDown`, the same frames the crowd plays until a
// painting exists), and the survivors' own PAINTED walk goes with it as the

// ─── Boss deaths ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The one animation in the game that is NOT a loop: eight panels from the
// killing blow to the body lying still, played once across the boss's death
// beat, the last panel held as the corpse the next stage opens beside.
//
// A fall is joints — knees that buckle, arms that flail and drop, a head that
// lolls — and the first version of this sheet had none: its reference was the
// walk frame rolled over like a plank, which a player read, correctly, as a
// standing creature turned on its side. So the death is DRAWN now, by the same
// rigs that walk (`monsterKit`'s "Dying"): the blow, the stagger, the knees
// going, the fall onto its back (or, side-on, onto its flank) and the body
// lying spread out on the ground.
//
// THE REFERENCE IS THE ANIMATION. The painter follows its poses panel by panel
// and paints over them as the finished creature, with the creature's own
// PAINTED walk attached as the identity reference — the painted death has to be
// the same painted creature, or the swap at the kill is a costume change. The
// same drawing is baked as the game's own death until the painting exists
// (`monsterSprites.monsterDeathFrame`), so both tell one fall.

   * A projectile is the case this exists for. A boss's meteor is a rock inside

 * contact sheet with captions) and an image model that has been taught one
 * sheet shape for the cast should not be handed a different one for a rock.
 *
 * The one thing it says that a walk's does not: WHAT IS ALLOWED TO MOVE. A
 * creature's whole body moves through a stride, but a projectile is a solid
 * object inside an effect, and only the effect may change. A meteor whose stone
 * grows, shrinks or wanders between panels is a rock that pulses when it falls
 * — and the head of a round is what the game measures its kill against, so a
 * head that moves in the art is a hitbox that lies.
