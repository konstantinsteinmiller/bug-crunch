/**
 * ─── The survivor ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One character, drawn from BEHIND, because that is the only angle a vertical
 * runner ever shows: the crowd runs away up the screen. A back view also solves
 * the hardest problem in a crowd game — at 30 px a face is noise, but a
 * silhouette of pack + shoulders + bobbing head reads instantly, and reads the
 * same whether there are three of them or a hundred and ninety.
 *
 * The design agrees with the monster cast on purpose (same ink colour, same key
 * light, same line weights, same cel ramp from `inkArt`), so the two sides of
 * the fight look like they were drawn by one hand.
 *
 * ─── Why it is baked ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A survivor costs ~60 path operations. At 190 of them on screen that is 11 000
 * path ops per frame, which no phone will do at 60 fps. So each outfit is
 * rendered ONCE into a 14-frame strip covering exactly one stride, and the
 * battlefield blits. Baking happens in idle slices; until a strip exists the
 * renderer falls back to a cheap capsule, so the first frame is never empty and
 * the frame budget is never blown.

// this was spin the running body about its own feet and fade it out across the
// whole 420 ms it has left, which at crowd size reads as a body being deleted —
// the owner's words were "they just quickly disappear". A fall is three beats
// instead: the blow stops it dead, it pitches over, and it lands and lies there.
//
// It is drawn with the boss cast's own vocabulary (`monsterKit`'s "Dying"):
// `deathBeats` times it, `fallOntoBack` puts the body on the ground, and
// `deathArm` / `deathLeg` / `deathLoll` spread the limbs. One size down, with
// one difference that decides the whole pose — a survivor is drawn from BEHIND
// and has no face, so it can never go over onto its back toward the camera.
// It lands PRONE: the pack up, the crown of the hood to the viewer, the boot
// soles turned up. That is also the only read a children's game can afford —
// a bundle of a person face down on the road, no wound, nothing to see.
//
// And it costs nothing per frame, which is the other constraint. Up to 190
// bodies are drawn and this is the hottest loop in the renderer — the
// 2026-09-12 row of PERF-LEDGER.md bought frame time back by deleting the
// per-body contact shadow. So the fall is BAKED like the stride is: two more
// frames per outfit, drawn once, and a dying body then costs a transform and
// the same single blit a living one pays. The contact shadow is inside the
// bake, where it is free.

 *   fallen  the body, lying prone across the road where it came down.
 *
 * Two rather than the boss's eight: the owner asked for one ("1 frame is
 * enough"), and the second earns its keep by being the IMPACT. A cut straight
