/**
 * ─── Staged art loading ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * With painted art on, the naive version fetches the whole set at once: every
 * strip, every prop, every round and effect — fifty-odd files, most of them for
 * things a first-time player will not see for ten minutes. A brute debuts on
 * stage 7 and the healer's bolt on stage 4; a first-time player on a phone
 * would pay for both on stage 1.
 *
 * So the set is staged, and the stages are DERIVED from the game's own tables
 * rather than listed: a design's tier is the first stage it can walk on, read
 * off `foeRoster` through `stageDesigns`; a round's tier is the first stage
 * its miniboss or boss kind can be fielded. Balance changes move the art with
 * them, and nothing here goes stale when a stage is retuned.
 *
 *   tier 0 — behind the splash, `fetchPriority: high`. What the FIRST SCREEN
 *            shows: the squad, the roster walking at them, the horizon, the
 *            gates and the post between their leaves, the pickups, and the
 *            effects every shot makes.
 *   tier 1 — once the page's own load is done and the thread has an idle slot,
 *            normal priority, one at a time, in the order the stage reaches
 *            them: the skills, the elite's crown, the weapon puzzle, the boss
 *            and what it throws, then the next stage on the same terms.
 *   tier 2 — after tier 1 has settled, `fetchPriority: low`, in one batch.
 *            Everything else, so nothing a resuming player skipped past is
 *            orphaned. Skipped outright on a data-saver connection.
 *
 * Nothing waits on tiers 1 or 2. A design whose strip has not arrived when it
 * first walks on simply draws its procedural body, exactly as it does with the
 * art switched off.
 *
 * ─── What tier 0 is FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first-time player, on stage 1, from a cold cache. They are the only
 * player who sees the game for the first time, and what they must see is a
 * finished picture — so the splash holds for everything on screen in the
 * opening seconds and for nothing that arrives later, however certain it is to
 * arrive. Every file moved out of tier 0 is time off that player's first
 * impression; every file left in that they cannot see yet is time spent on
 * nothing.
 *
 * The line, therefore, is WHEN IT IS ON SCREEN, not whether the stage has it:
 * the boss stands a stage away, the elite is a midpoint, the weapon puzzle is
 * an optional beat partway down the road. All three are tier 1, and tier 1
 * starts the moment the splash is down.
 *
 * ─── …and why sound is not here at all ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `useAssets` runs the SFX decode only once this module's promise resolves —
 * i.e. after every painting has landed — and the music element is pointed at a
 * track by `useSound` when a battle starts, so it is fetched on demand and
 * never competes. An SFX that has not decoded is a frame of latency the first
 * time it fires; a strip that has not arrived is a red ellipse in the middle of
 * the screen. The art wins every time.
 */

/**
 * The stage the player is about to play, or 1 for a new player.
 *
 * `ts_stage` is the campaign position — the stage a wipe restarts — and the
 * loader already reads it for the sprite bake, so it is the right key here
 * too: the enemies it names are the ones the first frame will show.
