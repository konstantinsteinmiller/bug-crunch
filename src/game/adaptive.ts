/**
 * ─── Adaptive difficulty, stages 1–5 ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The opening five stages size their boss against the run that actually turned
 * up, instead of against a curve authored for an imaginary average player.
 *
 * ─── The problem it exists to fix ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A fixed health bar cannot serve both ends of the funnel, and measured on the
 * live build it was serving neither (`tests/sim/scratch.adaptive.test.ts`,
 * before this file existed):
 *
 *   stage 5, `optimal`   468 survivors, 4 984 DPS against a 1 240 bar. The bar
 *                        is worth a quarter of a second of fire; the three
 *                        seconds the stopwatch showed were guard phases, and
 *                        the health bar teleported between them in three
 *                        instant chunks. Nothing about that reads as a fight.
 *   stage 5, a 40-crowd  76 DPS against the same bar: never killed it, on any
 *                        seed. Sixteen seconds of shooting and then a wipe.
 *
 * Both are the same bug from opposite sides. A player who reads the road
 * perfectly and one who barely steers arrive at the same door with a **65×**
 * spread in firepower, and one authored number cannot be a climax for both. So
 * the number stops being authored.
 *
 * ─── What it promises ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The boss is priced at *the firepower that walked into the arena × how long
 * this player has earned the fight to last*. The second term is the whole
 * design, and it runs the opposite way to the first: **playing well buys a
 * SHORTER fight, not an easier one.**
 *
 *   near-perfect crowd   ~3 s of straight fire. The reward for a clean road is
 *                        watching a boss that would flatten anybody else come
 *                        apart under sustained fire — three seconds is long
 *                        enough to feel like power and far too short to be a
 *                        grind.
 *   some mistakes        ~5 s.
 *   a bad run            ~6 s.
 *   1–12 survivors       ~6.8 s, and no more. This player cannot be helped and
 *                        the design does not try: they will be smacked by every
 *                        slam they fail to read and they will probably lose. If
 *                        they hold their nerve, the bar is beatable — a fight
 *                        that is unwinnable at the second the arena opens is a
 *                        result screen with extra steps.
 *
 * ─── Why "seconds of straight fire" and not stopwatch seconds ───────────────
 *
 * The two are different, by a fixed and knowable amount: the boss owes the
 * player a guard phase at each of `bossGuardGates`, and during one it is immune
 * while it plants and swings. Measured, a phase costs about 1.15 s, so a stage
 * with two of them (everything from stage 2) runs about 2.3 s longer on a
 * stopwatch than it does on this clock, and stage 1 — one gate — about 1.15 s.
 *
 * The ladder is written in FIRE seconds because that is the number the player
 * experiences as the fight: it is how long the bar is moving. Targeting the
 * stopwatch instead would hand a strong player a three-second fight containing
 * seven tenths of a second of shooting, which is precisely the melting bar this
 * file was written to stop.
 *
 * The stopwatch times that fall out are measured rather than predicted, because
 * the walk-in and the DPS a dodging crowd gives up by moving are both in them.
 * Across the scripted policies on stages 1–5 they run **4.3 s** for a run that
 * read the road, 5.8–6.3 s for a good one, 7.0–7.3 s for a sloppy one and
 * 8.4 s for twelve survivors who dodge properly — inside the 5–8 s window the
 * climax was always designed for (see `BOSS_BASE_HP`), with the bottom rung
 * under the ten-second ceiling the brief sets for a hopeless crowd. The full
 * table is in `tests/sim/REPORT.md`.
 *
 * ─── What it deliberately does NOT do ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads the crowd, and only the crowd, to decide the target. It would be
 * easy to score the run on DPS instead — the crates are where the real spread
 * lives — but DPS is already the other half of the formula, and scoring on it
 * too would mean a player who found every crate was charged for it twice. The
 * crowd is also the thing the player can see: the HUD counts it, the gates
 * print it, and "I had a big army so the boss went down fast" is a sentence a
 * seven-year-old can say out loud.
 *
 * It also stops at stage 5. From stage 6 the authored curve takes over
 * unchanged — by then the player has committed, the shop matters, and a boss
 * whose bar is always exactly as big as you are is a boss your upgrades cannot
 * beat.
 */

/**
 * The last stage the adaptive bar covers.
 *
 * Five, because that is where the onboarding curves in `survival.ts` already
 * let go, and because the retention data this was built from says the decision
 * to stay or leave is made inside the first few stages: a session that survives
 * them runs 5–22 minutes.

 * ─── The ladder ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Seconds of straight fire the boss should be worth, against the share of the
 * perfect-play crowd the player actually assembled (`perfectSquadFor`).
 *
 * Read as a curve rather than as four cases: the value is interpolated between
 * neighbouring rungs, so there is no cliff a player can feel themselves fall
 * off, and no threshold worth gaming.
 *
 * The top rung is a PLATEAU rather than a peak at 1.0, and where it sits is the
 * one number here that is about honesty rather than feel. `perfectSquadFor` is
 * a ceiling nobody reaches: it assumes every bank is read correctly, every
 * pumpable leaf is pumped for the whole approach, and not one survivor is lost
 * on the road. Measured, the benchmark `optimal` policy lands at **0.75–0.86**
 * of it, so 0.75 is where "played it about as well as it can be played"
 * actually sits. A peak at 1.0 would reserve the best reward in the game for a
 * run that cannot happen.
 *
 * ─── The one stage where the yardstick is soft ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stage 4 is an outlier and it is recorded here rather than tuned away, because
 * the cause is a real property of that road. It is the first stage carrying
 * boulders and barricades, and `optimal` finishes it having lost **50**
 * survivors against 1 on stages 2, 3 and 5. Losses on a road with multipliers on
 * it compound — twenty survivors lost before a `×2` leaf cost forty — so the
 * doors-only ceiling over-states what stage 4 can actually hand over, and even a
 * flawless run scores about 0.46 there.
 *
 * The consequence is that stage 4's climax runs a second or two longer than its
 * neighbours' for the same quality of play. That is left alone: stage 4 is where
 * this game stops being a tutorial by design (it is the stage that stops a
 * no-input run dead), and a slightly heavier fight is the right note for it.
 * Modelling road attrition to close the gap would mean inventing a per-body loss
 * rate, and a made-up number in the yardstick is worse than a measured wart.

/**
 * ─── The crowd does not survive the fight it is being sized for ─────────────
 *
 * A target of seven seconds spent against the DPS measured at the arena door is
 * not seven seconds of fight, and the gap is not small. The boss's entire job is
 * to kill survivors: by the fourth second the crowd producing that DPS is
 * smaller than the crowd the bar was priced against, so the fight over-runs —
 * measured on the first cut of this file, by 40 % at the bottom of the ladder,
 * which is how a 7.3 s target became a 12.6 s stopwatch and broke the one
 * promise the brief states as a limit.
 *
 * It is worst exactly where it can be afforded least. A slam takes
 * `max(BOSS_MIN_KILL, squad × share)` — a floor and a share — so a crowd of
 * twenty loses a far bigger PROPORTION of itself per swing than a crowd of four
 * hundred, and it is already the crowd with the longest target. Rage compounds
 * it: every swing thrown pulls the next one closer, so a long fight is not just
 * more swings, it is more swings per second.
 *
 * So the bar is priced against the damage the crowd will actually deliver,
 * integrated rather than multiplied. `expectedDamage` walks the fight forward in
 * small steps with the real slam machinery — the same cadence, the same decay,
 * the same floor — and adds up what the shrinking crowd puts out. That number IS
 * the health, which is what makes the target mean what it says.
 *
 * It is a model, not a simulation, and it is wrong in one direction on purpose:
 * see `SLAM_CONNECT_RATE`.

 * phase, and the count is `bossGuardGates(stage).length` — one on stage 1, two
 * from stage 2.
 *
 * It matters here for one reason: the slam clock runs during a guard phase and
 * the damage clock does not. A fight targeted at seven seconds of fire is
 * nine-and-a-bit seconds of standing in front of a boss that is swinging the
 * whole time, so the crowd decays for the longer of the two windows while paying

 * shot at, a healer's bolts land between casts, and the claw's rake has a core
 * that ignores the budget entirely. None of those are worth modelling
 * individually — they differ per kind and per seed — but together they are why
 * the first cut of this file, which counted swings alone at two-thirds
 * connection, still ran 25 % long at the bottom of the ladder.
 *
 * So the number is calibrated rather than derived: one swing's bite per cycle is
