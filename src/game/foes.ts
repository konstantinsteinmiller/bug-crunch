 *
 * Five archetypes, each answering a different question the player has to solve
 * with the same two verbs (shoot / steer):
 *
 *   creep  — many, weak. Punishes standing still on a gate too long.
 *   husk   — the baseline body. Shows up in packs from stage 2.
 *   hound  — fast. Reaches you before you have finished pumping.
 *   brute  — slow and thick. Must be shot early or dodged entirely.
 *   flyer  — ignores barricades and drifts sideways. Punishes tunnel vision.

 *
 * ─── Why this is not a straight line ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A run's power is a PRODUCT of three growing terms — squad × damage × fire
 * rate — and it grows ×138 over a thirty-stage career. A linear boss cannot
 * track that, and the career simulation showed exactly how it failed: the boss
 * out-grew the player over stages 1–4 (a 25-second slog on stage 3), the player
 * ran away from the boss over 5–12 (DPS ×16.2 against boss HP ×2.1), and from
 * stage 8 onward the boss DIED BEFORE ITS FIRST SLAM — a climax that never
 * swung, on twenty-three consecutive stages.
 *
 * The measured mismatch is localised, so the curve is too:
 *
 *   stages 1–4   flat — the early boss was the one part that was too HARD
 *   stages 5–12  ×1.55 a stage, the window where the player's compounding runs
 *                away from anything linear
 *   stages 13+   +12 % a stage, because past twelve the original linear slope
 *                was measured as already correct (×2.3 against the player's
 *                ×2.4)
 *
 * Simulated against the DPS runs actually arrive with, this moves median
 * time-to-kill across stages 8–30 from 1.1 s to 6.7 s for a competent player
 * and from 0.5 s to 3.5 s for a perfect one — into the 5–8 s window the fight
 * was designed for.
 *
 * It propagates to minibosses through `track.minibossHp`, which is deliberate:
 * they are sized as a fraction of the climax and should follow it.

/**
 * ─── Every stage ends in a boss ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stage 1 briefly did not. After the fit test put 64 % of sessions inside two
 * minutes, the climax was cut back to a single weakened elite
 * (`MINIBOSS_TUTORIAL`) on the theory that a stranger should not be asked to
 * learn the road, the gates, the crates AND a boss before deciding to stay.
 *
 * That went too far. A level that simply stops — no arena, no big one, no
 * moment — reads as unfinished rather than as gentle, and it teaches the wrong
 * shape for every stage that follows. So the boss is back, and the fix for the
 * original problem is its PRICE rather than its absence: stage 1's boss is the
 * same creature the player just beat halfway down the road, at boss size and
 * barely tougher (`TUTORIAL_BOSS_HP`). It is a victory lap with a health bar.
 *
 * The pattern it establishes is stage 2's as well — meet the shape, beat a small
 * one, then meet it again as the thing at the end. See `bossDesign`.

/**
 * ─── The arena kit: what makes each boss fight its own fight ────────────────
 *
 * Stages 1–5 teach the game; from 6 the player knows how to play and the job
 * changes from teaching to keeping them curious. A boss that is always "hold
 * fire on the big one, dodge the slam" is the same fight fifteen times, and the
 * player fit test said what that costs.
 *
 * So the arena is furnished per stage. The table below is authored, not rolled,
 * for the same reason stages 1–5 are: each entry should introduce or recombine
 * exactly one idea, and a seeded shuffle cannot promise that.
 *
 *   barrels — TNT the crowd can shoot for a big hit that lands THROUGH the
 *             boss's shield. The answer to "my gun does nothing right now" and
 *             to "this boss out-scales my damage".
 *   escort  — the boss does not stand alone; a pack holds the arena with it, so
 *             fire has to be spent on something other than the health bar.
 *
 * Read the column downward and it is a rhythm rather than a ramp: barrels are
 * introduced alone (6), then have to be reached past an escort (8), then arrive
 * in numbers against a boss built to out-tank the crowd (10, 13), with plain
 * fights kept in between (7, 9, 12) so the furnished ones stay special.
