/**
 * ─── Weapon upgrades — the puzzle prize ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One optional, self-contained beat per stage that pays out a WEAPON for the
 * rest of that stage. It is the only thing in the game that is not on the way:
 * everything else the road offers — crates, banks, coins — is collected by
 * steering slightly better than you were already steering. This has to be
 * NOTICED first.
 *
 * The shape, in order down the road:
 *
 *      ▲ stone                                            (one shoulder)
 *      lever ◄──
 *                 ▲ stone                                 (the other, 3 units on)
 *                 ──► lever
 *
 *                            ▓▓▓▓  ← armour, 12 units on
 *                            [W]     the box behind it
 *
 * Break the stone, shoot the lever, twice. Both levers and the armour comes off
 * before the crowd arrives. One, or neither, and the box goes past behind a
 * wall nobody has the road left to chew through. That is the whole mechanic,
 * and it is deliberately a test of ATTENTION rather than of DPS: the levers are
 * cheap to break and expensive to find, sitting out at the rails where nothing
 * else in the game ever asks the player to point.
 *
 * The stones are the answer to the beat's one measured flaw — the sweep was
 * free. A crowd steering anywhere near a lever's column deleted it in passing,
 * so "did you notice" quietly became "did you drift", and a puzzle that solves
 * itself on a stray round is not a puzzle. A stone in front of each post means
 * the round has to be SPENT there: point at the lever, hold it, and be pointing
 * long enough to matter. See `LEVER_STONE_HP_MUL` for why it is not more than
 * that.
 *
 * Three rules keep it a gift rather than a tax:
 *
 *   1. IT IS NEVER IN THE WAY. The box and its armour sit on one shoulder, and
 *      `WEAPON_FREE_LANE` guarantees the remaining road is wider than a crowd
 *      at full size. A player who ignores the whole beat pays nothing.
 *   2. IT NEVER OUTLIVES THE STAGE. The weapon is cleared by `startStage`, so
 *      it is a reward for reading THIS road, not a permanent power spike that
 *      makes the next one trivial. See `activeWeapon` in `useSurvivalGame`.
 *   3. THE TWO PRIZES ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES, not different sizes. See below.
 *
 * ─── The two weapons ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are priced to roughly the same single-target DPS multiplier and to very
 * different feels, so "which stage am I on" is a change of plan rather than a
 * change of number:
 *
 *   GATLING — `streams` unchanged, fire rate x2.2, damage x2. A hose. Best
 *             against the one thing in the game with a health bar long enough
 *             to matter (a boss, an elite), and the safe pick when the crowd is
 *             small, because every round still has to hit something.
 *   ROCKET  — a HANDFUL of streams, fire rate x0.6, damage x5.5, and a blast.
 *             Fewer, far heavier rounds. Worse into a single body, and the only
 *             thing in the player's hands that answers a pack of twelve at once.
 *
 * The DPS identity that makes this tunable: total damage per second is
 * `squad x damage x fireRate x rateMul x damageMul`, and `streams` cancels out
 * of it entirely (a stream fires `fireRate` times a second and each round
 * carries `squad x damage / streams`). So `streams` is a pure FEEL dial — it
 * decides how many, how fat and how far apart the rounds are — and the balance
 * lives in the two multipliers alone.

   * ─── Why the launcher had to grow with the crowd ────────────────────────
   *
   * It shipped at a flat ONE stream, and that is DPS-correct and feels wrong:
   * a squad of four and a squad of four hundred both fired a single rocket at a
   * time, so the weapon looked identical at every point on the curve while the
   * number behind it grew by two orders of magnitude. Player-reported, in as
   * many words: *"only fires one round no matter the size of the squad"*.
   *
   * Scaling alone did not fix it, and the second report says why: *"the rocket
   * launcher is still only firing 1 bullet"*. `streamsPer` was 12 off a base of
   * ONE, so every squad under a dozen — which is most of a stage's opening, and
   * every run that is going badly — still watched a single round leave. The
   * base is now the floor of the salvo (see `WEAPONS.rocket`), so the smallest
   * crowd that can hold a launcher still fires a volley with it.
   *
   * Because `streams` cancels out of the DPS product, this is a pure feel dial
   * — five launchers each carry a fifth of what one carried, arrive five times
   * as often, and the stage takes exactly as long to clear. What changes is
   * that the crowd you built is visible in the thing it is firing.
   *
   * Capped, and capped low. The whole read of the launcher is that it is NOT
   * the hose beside it; at fourteen streams it would be a slower gatling with a
   * blast, and the two weapons would stop being a choice.

   * second leaving from five places — which is exactly the picture the flat

   * after the first fix. Fired together, the same five rounds are a SALVO: the
   * front rank lights up at once, five trails fan out to five different bodies,
   * and the pause afterwards is the reload rather than the weapon.
   *
   * It is free in DPS terms. `stepShooting` divides the cadence by the salvo
   * size and multiplies the rounds per trigger by it, so the shot budget over

 * intent and the arithmetic now agree. What the wider window buys is the WEAK
 * squad — the one this constant was cut for — which now opens the box in front
 * of itself instead of on the last frame before contact. Measured across four
 * squad sizes on stage 2, the break distance was 5.93 / 5.99 / 6.00 / 6.00
 * units shut — clamped flat by the unlock rather than by anybody's damage — and
 * 11.2 to 13.0 open. `balance.test.ts` re-run either side: 24/24 both times,

 *
 * It looks like one — a slab with health, sitting across the road, deleted by

 * of them were invisible until something else in the game tripped over it:
 *
 *   1. IT MUST NOT KILL. Every wall in this game erases whoever runs into it,
 *      and the difficulty curve is tuned around how many of them a stage puts
 *      out. This beat adds two more, on every stage from 4, that the curve
 *      never budgeted for — and it adds them to a BONUS the player did not ask
 *      for. The game's own rule for props attached to a reward is the supply
 *      crate's: a reward that punishes the approach as hard as a wall teaches
 *      players to stop approaching rewards. So a plate grinds like a crate.
 *      (Measured before the split: two existing balance tests died on it, both
 *      because a crowd steering an ordinary line was deleted by armour that had
 *      no business being lethal.)
 *   2. IT MUST NOT BE COUNTED AS ONE. `getBarricades()` means "the walls this
 *      stage laid out" to a dozen call sites — the renderer, the crowd's
 *      obstacle avoidance, `deathBreakdown`, the balance harness. Quietly
 *      widening that set to include a puzzle's furniture makes every one of
 *      those answer a slightly different question than it used to.
 *
 * What it keeps from a wall: it is solid to rounds, it has real health, and the
 * crowd routes around it. What it does not keep is the teeth.

   * ─── A GIFT IS BORN OPEN, AN EARNED BOX IS NOT ────────────────────────────
   *
   * `locked` used to start true for EVERY box, gift included, and the gift has
   * no armour to be locked by — so what actually opened it was the proximity
   * test at the top of `stepWeaponBoxes` ("nothing is covering this any more"),
   * which does not run until the box is inside `anchorY + 6`. Measured on
   * stage 2 (speed 5.21 u/s, `CROWD_SCREEN_Y × VIEW_HEIGHT` = 13.68 units of
   * visible road):
   *
   *   • the box slides on screen 13.68 units out — 2.63 s before contact;
   *   • it read as a SHUT grey crate under a cross-brace for the first 7.68 of
   *     those units, 1.48 s, 56 % of the entire approach;
   *   • the prize only lit up at 6 units, 1.15 s out.
   *
   * The first theory of the bug was that 1.15 s is not enough road to react in,
   * and the measurement KILLED it: a full-lane correction settles in about a
   * quarter of a second (`weaponPuzzle.test.ts` times it), so six units is four
   * or five crossings' worth of slack. Steering was never the binding
   * constraint — which is precisely why a closed box survived this long, since
   * nobody could point at a moment where the prize was unreachable.
   *
   * What it actually cost is two other things:
   *
   *   1. THE OBJECT SIGNALLED THE WRONG CATEGORY for the majority of its
   *      approach. Braced grey steel is what an obstacle looks like on this
   *      road; the one beat on stage 2 whose whole job is to be walked into
   *      spent 56 % of its visible life dressed as a thing to walk around.
   *   2. IT WAS NOT SHOOTABLE. This box is opened by gunfire, not by contact,
   *      and a locked box refuses damage outright — so the guns got 6 units of
   *      window where `BULLET_RANGE` offers 10.83, and the shortfall lands on
   *      exactly the weak squad the beat exists to rescue.
   *
   * (2) also silently halved the window the box is PRICED against:
   * `WEAPON_GIFT_HP_MUL` is sized on "the ~2 s of gunfire between coming into
   * range and walking over it" — so the real spendable window was
   * 6 / 5.21 = 1.15 s, not `BULLET_RANGE` / 5.21 = 2.08 s.
   *
   * So a gift spawns with `locked: false`. It is not a new state; it is the
   * absence of a state it never had a cause for.
   *
   * THE EARNED BOX STAYS SHUT, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.
   * The argument for opening it too is consistency; the argument against is that
   * the two boxes are not the same offer. The gift asks ONE question — "is this
   * worth steering into" — and the answer has to be on the object, because the
   * object is all there is. The earned box asks "is this worth going to find two
   * levers for", and the player already has that answer for free: `WeaponTag`
   * names the weapon on the HUD from the moment the beat streams in, twelve
   * units before the box is even on screen. Opening the case as well would buy
   * no information and spend the one thing the puzzle has — `unlockPuzzle`'s
   * reveal is the only moment in the game that says "the thing you shot did
   * THIS", and a lid that was already off cannot say it. Consistency of
   * INFORMATION (both beats tell you the weapon before you commit) is the
   * promise worth keeping; consistency of APPEARANCE would cost the mechanic
   * its one teacher.
