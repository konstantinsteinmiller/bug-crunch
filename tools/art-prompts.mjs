/**
 * Regenerate `art-sheets/PROMPTS-*.md` from the manifest, with no browser —
 * and write `art-sheets/PAINT-STATUS.md` beside them.
 *
 *   pnpm art:prompts            # writes the prompt documents + the status report
 *   pnpm art:prompts --check    # exits 1 if a prompt document is out of date (CI)
 *
 * From the art-generation-pipeline skill (`templates/art-prompts.mjs`), adapted
 * to bug-crunch: the index is `{ walks: [...] }` with a `fit` per entry, and
 * the sheets are the manifest's walks, stills and boss deaths (`sheetRows()`).
 *
 * The bench (`/#/art-sheets`) writes the same documents on export — both routes
 * render `promptDocs()` from `src/game/artSheet.ts`, so they agree byte for
 * byte, and a manifest edit (a reworded blurb, a new sheet) has its prompt the
 * moment this runs. The manifest chain has to load under plain Node for that;
 * `tools/ts-resolve.mjs` is what makes it (the `@/` alias, the `.ts`
 * extension, and an empty `import.meta.env`).
 *
 * Run through the `--import` hook (the pnpm script does):
 *   node --import ./tools/ts-resolve.mjs tools/art-prompts.mjs
