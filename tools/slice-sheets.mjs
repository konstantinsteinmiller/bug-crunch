/**
 * ─── Sheet slicer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The return half of the art pipeline. `/art-sheets` bakes the procedural cast
 * onto reference sheets and out to an image model; this takes the repainted
 * sheet and cuts it back into the drop-in bitmaps `spriteFor()` probes for.
 *
 * Every sheet is a grid of panels that becomes ONE horizontal strip — a walk
 * cycle is eight panels, a still is a one-panel grid — so there is one code
 * path: identify, guard the aspect, key the ground, fit onto the reference,
 * compose, encode. See `art-sheets/README.md`.
 *
 *   node tools/slice-sheets.mjs art-sheets/painted/walk-grumpling.png
 *   pnpm slice-sheets                      # every PNG in art-sheets/painted/
 *   pnpm slice-sheets --dry                # print the plan, write nothing
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES A BROWSER
 *
 * The renderer only ever probes for `.webp`, and Node has no image encoder in
 * the standard library. The choice was a native dependency (`sharp`) in a
 * project that ships to eight portals, or the encoder that is already installed
 * on this machine. Chrome decodes the PNG, crops on a canvas and encodes WebP
 * in three lines — so the pipeline stays dependency-free, and it is the same
 * isolated-profile harness the export bench is driven with.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 * The whole contract is that cell N comes back at the pixels cell N went out
 * at. An image model that re-composed the grid produces a file that still looks
 * fine and slices into garbage — every sprite a few pixels off centre, which
 * nobody notices until the tower looks subtly wrong in motion. So a sheet whose
 * aspect ratio does not match the index is REJECTED rather than best-guessed.

                   still (crate-damage, frame-add, tracer, muzzle, lane, logo …).
                   Otherwise inferred from the filename, then from the aspect ratio.

  --size <px>      Force a frame's height, in px, for this run. Default: 256,
                   lowered to the sheet's own cap where that is smaller and
                   raised to the biggest resized copy a sheet ships. A sheet
                   the manifest marks 'exact' (the PWA logo) ignores both.
  --quality <0-1>  WebP quality. Default: 0.92
  --no-chroma      Keep a magenta background instead of keying it out.
  --no-auto-bg     Do not flood-fill a uniform background away. Auto-removal
                   handles white, cream and painted-in checkerboards; it never
                   runs on an opaque tile.
  --no-trim        Reserved; nothing in this manifest is trimmed.
  --fit squash|crop  Reserved; every return is fitted onto its reference.
  --frames <n>     Accept a walk sheet that came back with n panels instead of
                   the 8 it was asked for, and play them as one cycle. Must
                   match the grid the slicer measured.
  --take-rows <n>  A walk sheet came back with MORE rows than asked (a 4x4 for
                   a 4x2): cut only the first n rows and play them as the
                   cycle. Use this when the extra rows repeat the cycle;
                   use --frames when they continue it.
  --stale-ok       Slice a painting even though its reference was redrawn since it
                   was painted. Off by default: the receipt in
                   painted/.sliced.json is what stops a re-cut drawing quietly
                   getting its OLD painting back.
  --drop-borders   Cut a return that came back ruled like a comic strip, painting
                   the rules out of the cut lines first. Refused by default —
                   look at the return before using this, because a ruled one
                   usually has captions inside the panels, and those stay.
  --mirror         Flip every PANEL left-to-right before cutting, for a return
                   that came back facing the wrong way (the panel order is kept,
                   so the animation still runs forwards).
