/**
 * Which painted drop-ins are actually on disk, and which are still drawings.
 *
 *   pnpm art:status              # a summary per kind, plus what is missing
 *   pnpm art:status -- --all     # list every id, present or not
 *
 * From the art-generation-pipeline skill (`templates/art-status.mjs`), adapted
 * to splatix: the runtime catalogue (`ART_CATALOGUE`) lists the STILLS,
 * while the strips are keyed by ids the renderer takes from the game itself —
 * monster designs, survivor outfits, and the boss roster for deaths — so those
 * are read from the same sources here.
 *
 * The question this answers is "I sliced the art and only half the game
 * changed". A miss is SILENT by design — `spriteFor` treats a 404 as "keep
 * drawing this one" so a portal never sees a broken build — which is right in
 * play and useless at the bench. Nothing here touches a browser.
 *
 * Run through the `--import` hook (the pnpm script does):
 *   node --import ./tools/ts-resolve.mjs tools/art-status.mjs
